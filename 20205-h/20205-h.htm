<h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The belief that the only solid foundation for the accurate study of
American ethnology and linguistics must be in the productions of the
native mind in their original form has led me to the venturesome
undertaking of which this is the first issue. The object of the proposed
series of publications is to preserve permanently a number of rude
specimens of literature composed by the members of various American
tribes, and exhibiting their habits of thought, modes of expressions,
intellectual range and &aelig;sthetic faculties.</p>

<p>Whether the literary and historical value of these monuments is little
or great, they merit the careful attention of all who would weigh and
measure the aboriginal mind, and estimate its capacities correctly.</p>

<p>The neglect of this field of study is largely owing to a deficiency of
material for its pursuit. Genuine specimens of native literature are
rare, and almost or quite inaccessible. They remain in manuscript in the
hands of a few collectors, or, if printed, they are in forms not
convenient to obtain, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>as in the ponderous transactions of learned
societies, or in privately printed works. My purpose is to gather
together from these sources a dozen volumes of moderate size and
reasonable price, and thus to put the material within the reach of
American and European scholars.</p>

<p>Now that the first volume is ready, I see in it much that can be
improved upon in subsequent issues. I must ask for it an indulgent
criticism, for the novelty of the undertaking and its inherent
difficulties have combined to make it less finished and perfected than
it should have been.</p>

<p>If the series meets with a moderate encouragement, it will be continued
at the rate of two or three volumes of varying size a year, and will, I
think, prove ultimately of considerable service to the students of man
in his simpler conditions of life and thought, especially of American
man.</p>

<p class="sectionhead">&sect; 1. <i>The Name &#8220;Maya.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>In his second voyage, Columbus heard vague rumors of a mainland westward
from Jamaica and Cuba, at a distance of ten days&#8217; journey in a
<span class="nowrap">canoe.<a name="FNanchor_9-1_1" id="FNanchor_9-1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_9-1_1" class="fnanchor">9-1</a></span> Its inhabitants were said to be clothed, and the specimens
of wax which were found among the Cubans must have been brought <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>from
there, as they themselves did not know how to prepare it.</p>

<p>During his fourth voyage (1503-4), when he was exploring the Gulf
southwest from Cuba, he picked up a canoe laden with cotton clothing
variously dyed. The natives in it gave him to understand that they were
merchants, and came from a land called <span class="smcap nowrap">Maia.<a name="FNanchor_10-1_2" id="FNanchor_10-1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_10-1_2" class="fnanchor">10-1</a></span></p>

<p>This is the first mention in history of the territory now called
Yucatan, and of the race of the Mayas; for although a province of
similar name was found in the western extremity of the island of Cuba,
the similarity was accidental, as the evidence is conclusive that no
colony of the Mayas was found on the <span class="nowrap">Antilles.<a name="FNanchor_10-2_3" id="FNanchor_10-2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_10-2_3" class="fnanchor">10-2</a></span> These islands were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>peopled by a wholly different stock, the remnants of whose language
prove them to have been the northern outposts of the Arawacks of Guiana,
and allied to the great Tupi-Guaranay stem of South America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maya</span> was the patrial name of the natives of Yucatan. It was the proper
name of the northern portion of the peninsula. No single province bore
it at the date of the Conquest, and probably it had been handed down as
a generic term from the period, about a century before, when this whole
district was united under one government.</p>

<p>The natives of all this region called themselves <i>Maya uinic</i>, Maya men,
or <i>ah Mayaa</i>, those of Maya; their language was <i>Maya than</i>, the Maya
speech; a native woman was <i>Maya c&#295;uplal</i>; and their ancient capital
was <i>Maya pan</i>, the <span class="smcap">Maya</span> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>banner, for there of old was set up the
standard of the nation, the elaborately worked banner of brilliant
feathers, which, in peace and in war, marked the rallying point of the
Confederacy.</p>

<p>We do not know where they drew the line from others speaking the same
tongue. That it excluded the powerful tribe of the Itzas, as a recent
historian <span class="nowrap">thinks,<a name="FNanchor_12-1_4" id="FNanchor_12-1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_12-1_4" class="fnanchor">12-1</a></span> seems to be refuted by the documents I bring
forward in the present volume; that, on the other hand, it did not
include the inhabitants of the southwestern coast appears to be
indicated by the author of one of the oldest and most complete
dictionaries of the language. Writing about 1580, when the traditions of
descent were fresh, he draws a distinction between the <i>lengua de Maya</i>
and the <i>lengua de </i><span class="nowrap"><i>Campeche</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12-2_5" id="FNanchor_12-2_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_12-2_5" class="fnanchor">12-2</a></span> The latter was a dialect varying
very slightly from pure Maya, and I take it, this manner of indicat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>ing
the distinction points to a former political separation.</p>

<p>The name Maya is also found in the form <i>Mayab</i>, and this is asserted by
various Yucatecan scholars of the present generation, as Pio Perez,
Crescencio Carrillo, and Eligio Ancona, to be the correct ancient form,
while the other is but a Spanish <span class="nowrap">corruption.<a name="FNanchor_13-1_6" id="FNanchor_13-1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_13-1_6" class="fnanchor">13-1</a></span></p>

<p>But this will not bear examination. All the authorities, native as well
as foreign, of the sixteenth century, write <i>Maya</i>. It is impossible to
suppose that such laborious and earnest students as the author of the
Dictionary of Motul, as the grammarian and lexicographer Gabriel de San
Buenaventura, and as the educated natives whose writings I print in this
volume, could all have fallen into such a capital <span class="nowrap">blunder.<a name="FNanchor_13-2_7" id="FNanchor_13-2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_13-2_7" class="fnanchor">13-2</a></span></p>

<p>The explanation I have to offer is just the re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>verse. The use of the
terminal <i>b</i> in &#8220;Mayab&#8221; is probably a dialectic error, other examples of
which can be quoted. Thus the writer of the Dictionary of Motul informs
us that the form <i>maab</i> is sometimes used for the ordinary negative
<i>ma</i>, no; but, he adds, it is a word of the lower classes, <i>es palabra
de gente comun</i>. So I have little doubt but that <i>Mayab</i> is a vulgar
form of the word, which may have gradually gained ground.</p>

<p>As at present used, the accent usually falls on the first syllable,
<i>Ma&acute;ya</i>, and the best old authorities affirm this as a rule; but it is a
rule subject to exceptions, as at the end of a sentence and in certain
dialects Dr. Berendt states that it is not infrequently heard as
<i>Ma&acute;ya&acute;</i> or even <span class="nowrap"><i>Maya&acute;</i>.<a name="FNanchor_14-1_8" id="FNanchor_14-1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_14-1_8" class="fnanchor">14-1</a></span></p>

<p>The meaning and derivation of the word have given rise to the usual
number of nonsensical and far-fetched etymologies. The Greek, the
Sanscrit, the ancient Coptic and the Hebrew have all been called in to
interpret it. I shall refer to but a few of these profitless
suggestions.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Brasseur (de Bourbourg) quotes as the opinion of Don Ramon de
Ordo&ntilde;ez, the author of a strange work on American arch&aelig;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>ology, called
<i>History of the Heaven and the Earth</i>, that <i>Maya</i> is but an
abbreviation of the phrase <i>ma ay ha</i>, which, the Abb&eacute; adds, means word
for word, <i>non adest aqua</i>, and was applied to the peninsula on account
of the scarcity of water <span class="nowrap">there.<a name="FNanchor_15-1_9" id="FNanchor_15-1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_15-1_9" class="fnanchor">15-1</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately that phrase has no such, nor any, meaning in Maya; were it
<i>ma yan haa</i>, it would have the sense he gives it; and further, as the
Abb&eacute; himself remarked in a later work, it is not applicable to Yucatan,
where, though rivers are scarce, wells and water abound. He therefore
preferred to derive it from <i>ma</i> and <i>ha</i>, which he thought he could
translate either &#8220;Mother of the Water,&#8221; or &#8220;Arm of the <span class="nowrap">Land!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_15-2_10" id="FNanchor_15-2_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_15-2_10" class="fnanchor">15-2</a></span></p>

<p>The latest suggestion I have noticed is that of Eligio Ancona, who,
claiming that <i>Mayab</i> is the correct form, and that this means &#8220;not
numerous,&#8221; thinks that it was applied to the first native settlers of
the land, on account of the paucity of their <span class="nowrap">numbers!<a name="FNanchor_15-3_11" id="FNanchor_15-3_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_15-3_11" class="fnanchor">15-3</a></span></p>

<p>All this seems like learned trifling. The name may belong to that
ancient dialect from which are derived many of the names of the days and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>months in the native calendar, and which, as an esoteric language, was
in use among the Maya priests, as was also one among the Aztecs of
Mexico. Instances of this, in fact, are very common among the American
aborigines, and no doubt many words were thus preserved which could not
be analyzed to their radicals through the popular tongue.</p>

<p>Or, if it is essential to find a meaning, why not accept the obvious
signification of the name? <i>Ma</i> is the negative &#8220;no,&#8221; &#8220;not;&#8221; <i>ya</i> means
rough, fatiguing, difficult, painful, dangerous. The compound <i>maya</i> is
given in the Dictionary of Motul with the translations &#8220;not arduous nor
severe; something easy and not difficult to do;&#8221; <i>cosa no grave ni
recia; cosa facil y no dificultosa de hacer</i>. It was used adjectively as
in the phrase, <i>maya u chapahal</i>, his sickness is not dangerous. So they
might have spoken of the level and fertile land of Yucatan, abounding in
fruit and game, that land to which we are told they delighted to give,
as a favorite appellation, the term <i>u luumil ceh, u luumil cutz</i>, the
land of the deer, the land of the wild turkey; of this land, I say, they
might well have spoken as of one not fatiguing, not rough nor
exhausting.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&sect; 2. <i>The Maya Linguistic Family.</i></p>

<p>Whatever the primitive meaning and first application of the name Maya,
it is now used to signify specifically the aborigines of Yucatan. In a
more extended sense, in the expression &#8220;the Maya family,&#8221; it is
understood to embrace all tribes, wherever found, who speak related
dialects presumably derived from the same ancient stock as the Maya
proper.</p>

<p>Other names for this extended family have been suggested, as Maya-Kiche,
Mam-Huastec, and the like, compounded of the names of two or more of the
tribes of the group. But this does not appear to have much advantage
over the simple expression I have given, though &#8220;Maya-Kiche&#8221; may be
conveniently employed to prevent confusion.</p>

<p>These affiliated tribes are, according to the investigations of Dr. Carl
Hermann Berendt, the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The languages of these do not differ more, in their extremes, than the
French, Spanish, Italian and other tongues of the so-called Latin races;
while a number resemble each other as closely as the Greek dialects of
classic times.</p>

<p>What lends particular importance to the study of this group of languages
is that it is that which was spoken by the race in several respects the
most civilized of any found on the American continent. Copan, Uxmal and
Palenque are names which at once evoke the most earnest interest in the
mind of every one who has ever been attracted to the subject of the
arch&aelig;ology of the New World. This race, moreover, possessed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>an abundant
literature, preserved in written books, in characters which were in some
degree phonetic. Enough of these remain to whet, though not to satisfy,
the curiosity of the student.</p>

<p>The total number of Indians of pure blood speaking the Maya proper may
be estimated as nearly or quite 200,000, most of them in the political
limits of the department of Yucatan; to these should be added nearly
100,000 of mixed blood, or of European descent, who use the tongue in
daily <span class="nowrap">life.<a name="FNanchor_19-1_12" id="FNanchor_19-1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_19-1_12" class="fnanchor">19-1</a></span> For it forms one of the rare examples of American
languages possessing vitality enough not only to maintain its own
ground, but actually to force itself on European settlers and supplant
their native speech. It is no uncommon occurrence in Yucatan, says Dr.
Berendt, to find whole families of pure white blood who do not know one
word of Spanish, using the Maya exclusively. It has even intruded on
literature, and one finds it interlarded in books published in Merida,
very <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>much as lady novelists drop into French in their imaginative
<span class="nowrap">effusions.<a name="FNanchor_20-1_13" id="FNanchor_20-1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_20-1_13" class="fnanchor">20-1</a></span></p>

<p>The number speaking the different dialects of the stock are roughly
estimated at half a million, which is probably below the mark.</p>


<p class="sectionhead">&sect; 3. <i>Origin of the Maya Tribes.</i></p>

<p>The Mayas did not claim to be autochthones. Their legends referred to
their arrival by the sea from the East, in remote times, under the
leadership of Itzamna, their hero-god, and also to a less numerous,
immigration from the west, from Mexico, which was connected with the
history of another hero-god, Kukul C&agrave;n.</p>

<p>The first of these appears to be wholly mythical, and but a repetition
of the story found among so many American tribes, that their ancestors
came from the distant Orient. I have elsewhere explained this to be but
a solar or light <span class="nowrap">myth.<a name="FNanchor_20-2_14" id="FNanchor_20-2_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_20-2_14" class="fnanchor">20-2</a></span></p>

<p>The second tradition deserves more attention from the historian, as it
is supported by some of their chronicles and by the testimony of several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>of the most intelligent natives of the period of the conquest, which I
present on a later page of this volume.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that the Mayas, the Kiches and the Cakchiquels, in
their most venerable traditions, claimed to have migrated from the north
or west, from some part of the present country of Mexico.</p>

<p>These traditions receive additional importance from the presence on the
shores of the Mexican Gulf, on the waters of the river Panuco, north of
Vera Cruz, of a prominent branch of the Maya family, the <i>Huastecs</i>. The
idea suggests itself that these were the rearguard of a great migration
of the Maya family from the north toward the south.</p>

<p>Support is given to this by their dialect, which is most closely akin to
that of the Tzendals of Tabasco, the nearest Maya race to the south of
them, and also by very ancient traditions of the Aztecs.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that these two partially civilized races, the Mayas and
the Aztecs, though differing radically in language, had legends which
claimed a community of origin in some indefinitely remote past. We find
these on the Maya side narrated <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>in the sacred book of the Kiches, the
<i>Popol Vuh</i>, in the Cakchiquel <i>Records of Tecpan Atitlan</i>, and in
various pure Maya sources which I bring forward in this volume. The
Aztec traditions refer to the Huastecs, and a brief analysis of them
will not be out of place.</p>

<p>At a very remote period the Mexicans, under their leader Mecitl, from
whom they took their name, arrived in boats at the mouth of the river
Panuco, at the place called Panotlan, which name means &#8220;where one
arrives by sea.&#8221; With them were the Olmecs under their leader Olmecatl,
the Huastecs, under their leader Huastecatl, the Mixtecs and others.
They journeyed together and in friendship southward, down the coast,
quite to the volcanoes of Guatemala, thence to Tamoanchan, which is
described as the <a name="corr1" id="corr1"></a><ins class="correction" title="terrestrial">terrestial</ins> paradise, and afterwards, some of them
at least, northward and eastward, toward the shores of the Gulf.</p>

<p>On this journey the intoxicating beverage made from the maguey, called
<i>octli</i> by the Aztecs, <i>cii</i> by the Mayas, and <i>pulque</i> by the
Spaniards, was invented by a woman whose name was <i>Mayauel</i>, in which we
can scarcely err in recognizing the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>national appellation <span class="nowrap"><i>Maya</i>.<a name="FNanchor_23-1_15" id="FNanchor_23-1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_23-1_15" class="fnanchor">23-1</a></span>
Furthermore, the invention is closely related to the history of the
Huastecs. Their leader, alone of all the chieftains, drank to excess,
and in his drunkenness threw aside his garments and displayed his
nakedness. When he grew sober, fear and shame impelled him to collect
all those who spoke his language, and leaving the other tribes, he
returned to the neighborhood of Panuco and settled there
<span class="nowrap">permanently.<a name="FNanchor_23-2_16" id="FNanchor_23-2_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_23-2_16" class="fnanchor">23-2</a></span></p>

<p>The annals of the Aztecs contain frequent allusions to the Huastecs. The
most important contest between the two nations took place in the reign
of Montezuma the First (1440-1464). The attack was made by the Aztecs,
for the alleged reason that the Huastecs had robbed and killed Aztec
merchants on their way to the great fairs in Guatemala. The Huastecs are
described as numerous, dwelling in walled towns, possessing quantities
of maize, beans, feathers and precious stones, and painting their faces.
They were sig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>nally defeated by the troops of Montezuma, but not reduced
to <span class="nowrap">vassalage.<a name="FNanchor_24-1_17" id="FNanchor_24-1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_24-1_17" class="fnanchor">24-1</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of the Conquest the province of the Huastecs was densely
peopled; &#8220;none more so under the sun,&#8221; remarks the Augustinian friar
Nicolas de Witte, who visited it in 1543; but even then he found it
almost deserted and covered with ruins, for, a few years previous, the
Spaniards had acted towards its natives with customary treachery and
cruelty. They had invited all the chiefs to a conference, had enticed
them into a large wooden building, and then set fire to it and burned
them alive. When this merciless act became known the Huastecs deserted
their villages and scattered among the forests and <span class="nowrap">mountains.<a name="FNanchor_24-2_18" id="FNanchor_24-2_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_24-2_18" class="fnanchor">24-2</a></span></p>

<p>These traditions go to show that the belief among the Aztecs was that
the tribes of the Maya family came originally from the north or
northeast, and were at some remote period closely connected with their
own ancestors.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards first explored the coasts of Yucatan they found the

<p>As No. 15, the Peten district, was not conquered by the Spaniards until
1697, it was doubtless not included in the list drawn up by Herrera&#8217;s
authority, so that the above would correspond with his statement.</p>

<p>Each of these provinces was ruled by a hereditary chief, who was called
<i>batab</i>, or <i>batabil uinic</i> (<i>uinic</i>=man). He sometimes bore two names,
the first being that of his mother, the second of his father, as <i>Can
Ek</i>, in which <i>Can</i> was from the maternal, <i>Ek</i> from the paternal line.
The surname (<i>kaba</i>) descended through the male. It was called <i>hach
kaba</i>, the true name, or <i>hool kaba</i>, the head name. Much attention was
paid to preserving the genealogy, and the word for &#8220;of noble birth&#8221; was
<i>ah kaba</i>, &#8220;he who has a name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each village of a province was organized under a ruler, who was styled
<i>halach uinic</i>, the true or real man. Frequently he was a junior member
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>of the reigning family. He was assisted by a second in command, termed
<i>ah kulel</i>, as a lieutenant, and various subordinate officials, whose
duties will be explained in the notes to Nakuk Pech&#8217;s narrative.</p>

<p>Personal tenure of land did not exist. The town lands were divided out
annually among the members of the community, as their wants required,
the consumption of each adult being calculated at twenty loads (of a
man) of maize each year, this being the staple <span class="nowrap">food.<a name="FNanchor_27-1_19" id="FNanchor_27-1_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_27-1_19" class="fnanchor">27-1</a></span></p>


<p class="sectionhead">&sect; 5. <i>Grammatical Observations.</i></p>

<p>Compared with many American languages, the Maya is simple in
construction. It is analytic rather than synthetic; most of its roots
are monosyllables or dissyllables, and the order of their arrangement is
very similar to that in English. It has been observed that foreigners,
coming to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Yucatan, ignorant of both Spanish and Maya, acquire a
conversational knowledge of the latter more readily than of the
<span class="nowrap">former.<a name="FNanchor_28-1_20" id="FNanchor_28-1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_28-1_20" class="fnanchor">28-1</a></span></p>

<p>An examination of the language explains this. Neither nouns nor
adjectives undergo any change for gender, number or case. Before animate
nouns the gender may be indicated by the prefixes <i>ah</i> and <i>ix</i>,
equivalent to the English <i>he</i> and <i>she</i> in such expressions as
<i>he-bear</i>, <i>she-bear</i>. The plural particle is <i>ob</i>, which can be
suffixed to animate nouns, but is in fact the third person plural of the
personal pronoun.</p>

<p>The conjugations of the verbs are four in number. All passives and
neuters end in <i>l</i>, and also a certain number of active verbs; these
form the first conjugation, while the remaining three are of active
verbs only. The time-forms of the verb are three, the present, the
aorist, and the future. Taking the verb <i>nacal</i>, to ascend, these forms
are <i>nacal</i>, <i>naci</i>, <i>nacac</i>. The present indicative is:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<table width="60%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table 1">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Nacal in cah,</td>
  <td style="width: 50%">I ascend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Nacal &aacute; cah,</td>
  <td>thou ascendest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Nacal &uacute; cah,</td>
  <td>he ascends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Nacal c cah,</td>
  <td>we ascend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Nacal a cah ex,</td>
  <td>you ascend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Nacal u cah ob,</td>
  <td>they ascend.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When this form is analyzed, we discover that <i>in</i>, <i>&aacute;</i>, <i>&uacute;</i>, <i>c</i>,
<i>a-ex</i>, <i>u-ob</i>, are personal possessive pronouns, my, thy, his, our,
your, their; and that <i>nacal</i> and <i>cah</i> are in fact verbal nouns
standing in apposition. <i>Cah</i>, which is the sign of the present tense,
means the doing, making, being occupied or busy at something. Hence
<i>nacal in cah</i>, I ascend, is literally &#8220;the ascent, my being occupied
with.&#8221; The imperfect tense is merely the present with the additional
verbal noun <i>cuchi</i> added, as&mdash;</p>

<table width="60%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Nacal in cah cuchi,</td>
  <td style="width: 50%">I was ascending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Nacal &aacute; cah cuchi,</td>
  <td>Thou wast ascending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td style="padding-left: 6em;">etc.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><i>Cuchi</i> means carrying on, bearing along, and the imperfect may thus be
rendered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The ascent, my being occupied with, carrying on.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is what has been called by Friedrich M&uuml;ller the &#8220;possessive
conjugation,&#8221; the pronoun <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>used being not in the nominative but in the
possessive form.</p>

<p>The aorist presents a different mode of formation:&mdash;</p>

<table width="60%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Nac-en, (i.e. Naci-en)</td>
  <td style="width: 50%">I ascended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Nac-ech,</td>
  <td>Thou ascended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Naci,</td>
  <td>He ascended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Nac-on,</td>
  <td>We ascended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Nac-ex,</td>
  <td>You ascended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Nac-ob,</td>
  <td>They ascended.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Here <i>en</i>, <i>ech</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>ex</i>, are apparently the simple personal
pronouns I, thou, we, you, and are used predicatively. The future is
also conjugated in this form by the use of the verbal <i>bin</i>, <i>binel</i>, to
go:</p>

<table width="60%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Bin nacac en,</td>
  <td style="width: 50%">I am going to ascend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Bin nacac ech,</td>
  <td>Thou art going to ascend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td style="padding-left: 8em;">etc.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The present of all the active verbs uses this predicative form, while
their aorists and futures employ possessive forms. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<table width="60%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Ten cambezic,</td>
  <td style="width: 50%">I teach him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Tech cambezic,</td>
  <td>Thou teaches him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Lay cambezic,</td>
  <td>He teaches him.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Here, however, I must note a difference of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>opinion between eminent
grammatical critics. Friedrich M&uuml;ller considers all such forms as&mdash;</p>

<table width="60%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Nac-en,</td>
  <td style="width: 50%">I ascended,</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">to exhibit &#8220;the predicative power of the true verb,&#8221; basing his opinion
on the analogy of such expressions as&mdash;</p>

<table width="60%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Ten batab en,</td>
  <td style="width: 50%">I (am) a <span class="nowrap">chief.<a name="FNanchor_31-1_21" id="FNanchor_31-1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_31-1_21" class="fnanchor">31-1</a></span></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>M. Lucien Adam, on the other hand, says:&mdash;&#8220;The intransitive preterit
<i>nac-en</i> may seem morphologically the same as the Aryan <i>&aacute;s-mi</i>; but
here again, <i>nac</i> is a verbal noun, as is demonstrated by the plural of
the third person <i>nac-ob</i>, &#8216;the ascenders.&#8217; <i>Nac-en</i> comes to mean
&#8216;ascender [formerly] <span class="nowrap">me.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_31-2_22" id="FNanchor_31-2_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_31-2_22" class="fnanchor">31-2</a></span></p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the French critic is right, and that, in
fact, there is no true verb in the Maya, but merely verbal nouns,
<i>nomina actionis</i>, to which the pronouns stand either in the possessive
or objective relations, or, more remotely, in the possessive relation to
another verbal noun in apposition, as <i>cah</i>, <i>cuchi</i>, etc. The
importance of this point in estimating the structure of the language
will be appreciated by those who have paid any attention to the science
of linguistics.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>The objective form of the conjugation is composed of the simple personal
pronouns of both persons, together with the possessive of the agent and
the particle <i>ci</i>, which conveys the accessory notion of present action
towards. Thus, from <i>moc</i>, to tie:&mdash;</p>

<table width="60%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Ten c in moc ech,</td>
  <td style="width: 50%">I tie thee,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">literally,</td>
  <td style="width: 50%">I my present tying thee.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>These refinements of analysis have, of course, nothing to do with the
convenience of the language for practical purposes. As it has no dual,
no inclusive and exclusive plurals, no articles nor substantive verb, no
transitions, and few irregular verbs, its forms are quickly learned. It
is not polysynthetic, at any rate, not more so than French, and its
words undergo no such alteration by agglutination as in Aztec and
Algonkin. Syncopated forms are indeed common, but to no greater extent
than in colloquial English. The unit of the tongue remains the word, not
the sentence, and we find no immeasurable words, expressing in
themselves a whole paragraph, such as grammarians like to quote from the
Eskimo, Aztec, Qquichua and other highly synthetic languages.</p>

<p>The position of words in a sentence is not dissimilar from that in
English. The adjective <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>precedes the noun it qualifies, and sentences
usually follow the formula, subject&mdash;verbal&mdash;object. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td><i>Hemac</i></td>
  <td><i>cu</i></td>
  <td><i>yacuntic</i></td>
  <td><i>Diose,</i></td>
  <td></td>
  <td><i>utz</i></td>
  <td><i>uinic.</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>He</td>
  <td>who</td>
  <td>loves</td>
  <td>God,</td>
  <td>[is]</td>
  <td>good</td>
  <td>man.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But transposition is allowable, as&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td><i>Taachili</i></td>
  <td><i>u tzicic</i></td>
  <td><i>u</i></td>
  <td><i>yum</i></td>
  <td><i>uinic.</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Generally</td>
  <td>obeys</td>
  <td>his</td>
  <td>father,</td>
  <td>a man.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As shown in this last example, the genitive relation is indicated by the
possessive pronoun, as it sometimes was in English, &#8220;John, his book;&#8221;
but the Maya is &#8220;his book John,&#8221; <i>u huun Juan</i>.</p>

<p>Another method which is used for indicating the genitive and ablative
relations is the termination <i>il</i>. This is called &#8220;the determinative
ending,&#8221; and denotes whose is the object named, or of what. It is
occasionally varied to <i>al</i> and <i>el</i>, to correspond to the last
preceding vowel, but this &#8220;vocalic echo&#8221; is not common in Maya. While it
denotes use, it does not convey the idea of ownership. Thus, <i>u c&#295;een
in yum</i>, my father&#8217;s well, means the well that belongs to my father; but
<i>c&#295;enel in yum</i>, my father&#8217;s well, means the well from which he
obtains water, but in which he has no proprietorship. Material used is
indicated by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>this ending, as <i>xanil na</i>, a house of straw (<i>xan</i>, straw,
<i>na</i>, house).</p>

<p>Compound words are frequent, but except occasional syncope, the members
of the compound undergo no change. There is little resembling the
incapsulation (<i>emboitement</i>) that one sees in most American languages.
Thus, midnight, <i>chumucakab</i>, is merely a union of <i>chumuc</i>, middle, and
<i>akab</i>, night; dawn, <i>ahalcab</i>, is <i>ahal</i>, to awaken, <i>cab</i>, the world.</p>

<p>While from the above brief sketch it will be seen that the Maya is free
from many of the difficulties which present themselves in most American
tongues, it is by no means devoid of others.</p>

<p>In its <i>phonetics</i>, it possesses six elements which to the Spaniards
were new. They are represented by the signs:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="phonetic signs">
<tr>
  <td>c&#295;,</td>
  <td>k,</td>
  <td>pp,</td>
  <td>t&#295;,</td>
  <td>tz,</td>
  <td>&#596;.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Of these the c&#295; resembles dch, pronounced forcibly; the &#596; is as dz;
the pp is a forcible double p; and in the t&#295; the two letters are to
be pronounced separately and forcibly. There remains the <i>k</i> which is
the most difficult of all. It is a sort of palato-guttural, the only one
in the language, and its sound can only be acquired by long practice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>The <i>particles</i> are very numerous, and make up the life of the language.
By them are expressed the relations of space and time, and all the finer
shades of meaning. Probably no one not to the manor born could render
correctly their full force. Buenaventura, in his Grammar, enumerates
sixteen different significations of the particle <span class="nowrap"><i>il</i>.<a name="FNanchor_35-1_23" id="FNanchor_35-1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_35-1_23" class="fnanchor">35-1</a></span></p>

<p>The elliptical and obscure style adopted by most native writers, partly
from ignorance of the art of composition, partly because they imitated
the mystery in expression affected by their priests, forms a serious
obstacle even to those fairly acquainted with the current language.
Moreover, the older manuscripts contain both words and forms unfamiliar
to a cultivated Yucatecan of to-day.</p>

<p>I must, however, not omit to contradict formally an assertion made by
the traveler Waldeck, and often repeated, that the language has
undergone such extensive changes that what was written a century ago is
unintelligible to a native of to-day. So far is this from the truth
that, except for a few obsolete words, the narrative of the Conquest,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>written more than three hundred years ago, by the chief Pech, which I
print in this volume, could be read without much difficulty by any
educated native.</p>

<p>Again, as in all languages largely monosyllabic, there are many
significations attached to one word, and these often widely different.
Thus <i>kab</i> means, a hand; a handle; a branch; sap; an offence; while
<i>cab</i> means the world; a country; strength; honey; a hive; sting of an
insect; juice of a plant; and, in composition, promptness. It will be
readily understood that cases will occur where the context leaves it
doubtful which of these meanings is to be chosen.</p>

<p>These <i>homonyms</i> and <i>paronyms</i>, as they are called by grammarians,
offer a fine field for sciolists in philology, wherein to discover
analogies between the Maya and other tongues, and they have been
vigorously culled out for that purpose. All such efforts are
inconsistent with correct methods in linguistics. The folly of the
procedure may be illustrated by comparing the English and the Maya. I
suppose no one will pretend that these languages, at any rate in their
present modern forms, are related. Yet the following are but a few of
the many verbal similarities that could be pointed out:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<table width="40%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%"><span class="smcap">Maya.</span></td>
  <td style="width: 50%"><span class="smcap">English.</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>bateel,</td>
  <td>battle.</td>

<tr>
  <td>c&#295;ab,</td>
  <td>to grab, to take.</td>

  <td>hol,</td>
  <td>hole.</td>

  <td>hun,</td>
  <td>one.</td>

  <td>pol,</td>
  <td>poll (head).</td>

  <td>a pot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>pul,</td>
  <td>to pull, carry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>tun,</td>
  <td>stone.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>So with the Latin we could find such similarities as <i>volah</i>=volo,
<i>&#596;a</i>=dare, etc.</p>

<p>In fact, no relationship of the Maya linguistic group to any other has
been discovered. It contains a number of words borrowed from the Aztec
(Nahuatl); and the latter in turn presents many undoubtedly borrowed
from the Maya dialects. But this only goes to show that these two great
families had long and close relations; and that we already know, from
their history, traditions and geographical positions.</p>


<p class="sectionhead">&sect; 6. <i>The Numeral System.</i></p>

<p>The Mayas had a mathematical turn, and possessed a developed system of
numeration. It counted by units and scores; in other words, it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>was a
vigesimal system. The cardinal numbers were:&mdash;</p>

<table width="40%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="cardinal numbers">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Hun,</td>
  <td style="width: 50%">one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Ca,</td>
  <td>two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Ox,</td>
  <td>three.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Can,</td>
  <td>four.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Ho,</td>
  <td>five.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Uac,</td>
  <td>six.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Uuc,</td>
  <td>seven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Uaxac,</td>
  <td>eight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Bolon,</td>
  <td>nine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Lahun,</td>
  <td>ten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Buluc,</td>
  <td>eleven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Lahca,</td>
  <td>twelve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Oxlahun,</td>
  <td>thirteen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Canlahun,</td>
  <td>fourteen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Holhun,</td>
  <td>fifteen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Uaclahun,</td>
  <td>sixteen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Uuclahun,</td>
  <td>seventeen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Uaxaclahun,</td>
  <td>eighteen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Bolonlahun,</td>
  <td>nineteen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Hunkal,</td>
  <td>twenty.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The composition of these numerals from twelve to nineteen inclusive is
easily seen. <i>Lahun</i> is apparently a compound of <i>lah hun</i> (sc.
<i>uinic</i>), &#8220;it finishes one (man);&#8221; that is, in counting on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>fingers.
<i>Lah</i> means the end, to end, and also the whole of anything. <i>Kal</i>, a
score, is literally a fastening together, a shutting up, from the verb
<i>kal</i>, to shut, to lock, to button up, etc.</p>

<p>From twenty upward, the scores are used:&mdash;</p>

<table width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="twenty upward">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Hun tu kal,</td>
  <td class="tdr" style="width: 50%">one to the score, 21.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Ca tu kal,</td>
  <td class="tdr">two to the score, 22.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Ox tu kal,</td>
  <td class="tdr">three to the score, 23,</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">and so on up to</p>

<table width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="counting">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Ca kal,</td>
  <td class="tdr" style="width: 50%">two score, 40.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Above forty, three different methods can be used to continue the
numeration.</p>

<p>1. We may continue the same employed between 20 and 40, thus:&mdash;</p>

<table width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="counting">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Hun tu cakal,</td>
  <td class="tdr" style="width: 50%">one to two score, 41.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Ca tu cakal,</td>
  <td class="tdr">two to two score, 42.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Ox tu cakal,</td>
  <td class="tdr">three to two score, 43,</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">and so on.</p>

<p>2. The numeral copulative <i>catac</i> can be used, with the numeral particle
<i>tul</i>; as:&mdash;</p>

<table width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="counting">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Cakal catac catul,</td>
  <td class="tdr" style="width: 50%">two score and two, 42.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Cakal catac oxtul,</td>
  <td class="tdr">two score and three, 43.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>3. We may count upon the next score above, as:</p>

<table width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="counting">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%">Hun tu yoxkal,</td>
  <td class="tdr" style="width: 50%">one on the third score, 41.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Ca tu yoxkal,</td>
  <td class="tdr">two on the third score, 42.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Ox tu yoxkal,</td>
  <td class="tdr">three on the third score, 43.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>The last mentioned system is that advanced by Father Beltran, and is the
only one formally mentioned by him. It has recently been carefully
analyzed by Prof. Leon de Rosny, who has shown that it is a consistent
vigesimal <span class="nowrap">method.<a name="FNanchor_40-1_24" id="FNanchor_40-1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_40-1_24" class="fnanchor">40-1</a></span></p>

<p>It might be asked, and the question is pertinent, and is left unanswered
by Prof. Leon de Rosny, why <i>hun tu kal</i> means &#8220;one to the score,&#8221; and
<i>hun tu can kal</i> is translated, &#8220;one on the fourth score.&#8221; This
important shade of meaning may be given, I think, by the possessive <i>u</i>
which originally belonged in the phrase, but suffered elision. Properly
it should be,</p>

<p class="titlepage">Hun tu u can kal.</p>

<p>This seems apparent from other numbers where it has not suffered
elision, but merely incorporation, as:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="counting">
<tr>
  <td class="tdr">Hun tu yox kal</td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>hun tu u ox kal, 41.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdr">Hu tu yokal</td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>hun tu u ho kal, 81.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This system of numeration, advanced by Beltran, appears to have been
adopted by all of the later writers, who may have learned the Maya
largely from his Grammar. Thus, in the transla<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>tion of the Gospel of St.
John, published by the Baptist Bible Translation Society, chap. <span class="smcap">II</span>, v.
20; <i>Xupan uactuyoxkal hab utial u mental letile kulnaa</i>, &#8220;forty and six
years was this temple in <span class="nowrap">building;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_41-1_25" id="FNanchor_41-1_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_41-1_25" class="fnanchor">41-1</a></span> and in that of the Gospel of
St. Luke, said to have been the work of Father Joaquin Ruz, the same
system is <span class="nowrap">followed.<a name="FNanchor_41-2_26" id="FNanchor_41-2_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_41-2_26" class="fnanchor">41-2</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Beltran&#8217;s method has been severely criticised by Don Juan
Pio Perez, who ranks among the ablest Yucatecan linguists of this
century. He has pronounced it artificial, not in accordance with either
the past or present use of the natives themselves, and built up out of
an effort to assimilate the Maya to the Latin numeral system.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>I give his words in the original, from his unpublished essay on Maya
<span class="nowrap">grammar.<a name="FNanchor_42-1_27" id="FNanchor_42-1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_42-1_27" class="fnanchor">42-1</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Los Indios de Yucatan cuentan por veintenas, que llaman <i>kal</i> y en
cierto modo tienen diez y nueve unidades hasta completar la primera
veintena que es <i>hunkal</i> aunque en el curso de esta solo se encuentran
once numeros simples, pues los nombres de los restantes se forman de los
de la primera decena.</p>

<p>&#8220;Para contar de una &agrave; otra veintena los numeros fraccionarios &ograve; las diez
y nueve unidades, terminadas por la particula <i>tul</i> &ograve; su sincopa
<span class="nowrap"><i>tu</i>,<a name="FNanchor_42-2_28" id="FNanchor_42-2_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_42-2_28" class="fnanchor">42-2</a></span> se juntan antepuestas &agrave; la veintena espresada; por exemplo,
<i>hunkal</i>, 20; <i>huntukal</i>, 21; <i>catukal</i>, 22; y <i>huntucakal</i>, 41;
<i>catucakal</i>, 42; <i>oxtucankal</i>, 83; <i>cantuhokal</i>, 140, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;El Padre Fr. Beltran de Santa Rosa, como puede verse en su <i>Arte de
Lengua Maya</i>, form&oacute; un sistema distinto &agrave; este desde la 2&ordf; veintena
hasta la ultima, pues para espresar las unidades entre este y la 3&ordf;
veintena pone &agrave; esta terminandolas y por consiguiente rebajandole su
valor por solo su anteposicion &agrave; dichas unidades fraccion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>arias, y asi
para espresar el numero 45 por ejemplo dice <i>ho tu yoxkal</i>, cuando
<i>oxkal</i> &ograve; <i>yoxkal</i> significa 60.</p>

<p>&#8220;No s&eacute; de donde tom&oacute; los fundamentos en que se apoya este sistema, quiza
en el uso de su tiempo, que no ha llegado hasta este; aunque he visto en
varios manuscritos antiguos, que los Indios de entonces como los de
ahora, usaban el sistema que indico, y espresaban las unidades integras
que numeraban, y para espresar el numero 65 dicen; <i>Oxkal catac hotul</i> &ugrave;
<i>hotu oxkal</i>, que usa el Padre Beltran por <span class="nowrap">45.<a name="FNanchor_43-1_29" id="FNanchor_43-1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_43-1_29" class="fnanchor">43-1</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Mas el metodo que explico esta apoyado en el uso y aun en el curso que
se advierte en la 1&ordf; y 2&ordf; veintena &eacute; indican que asi deben continuar las
decenas hasta la 20&ordf; y no formar sistemas confusos que por ser mas &ocirc;
menos an&aacute;logos &agrave; la numeracion romana lo juzgaban mas &ocirc; menos perfectos,
porque la consideraban como un tipo a que debia arreglarse cualquiera
otra lengua, cuando en ellas todo lo que no este conforme con el uso
recibido y corriente, es construir castillos en el aire y hacer reformas
que por mas ingeniosas que sean, no pasan de inoficiosas.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the face of this severe criticism of Father <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>Beltran&#8217;s system, I
cannot explain how it is that in Pio Perez&#8217;s own Dictionary of the Maya,
the numerals above 40 are given according to Beltran&#8217;s system; and that
this was not the work of the editors of that volume (which was published
after his death), is shown by an autographic manuscript of his
dictionary in my possession, written about <span class="nowrap">1846,<a name="FNanchor_44-1_30" id="FNanchor_44-1_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_44-1_30" class="fnanchor">44-1</a></span> in which also the
numerals appear in Beltran&#8217;s form.</p>

<p>Three other manuscript dictionaries in my collection, all composed
previous to 1690, affirm the system of Beltran, and I am therefore
obliged to believe that it was authentic and current among the natives
long before white scholars began to dress up their language in the
ill-fitting garments of Aryan grammar.</p>

<p>Proceeding to higher numbers, it is interesting to note that they also
proceed on the vigesimal system, although this has not heretofore been
distinctly shown. The ancient computation was:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="larger units">
<tr>
  <td>20 units</td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>one <i>kal</i></td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td class="tdr">20</td>

<tr>
  <td>20 kal</td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>one <i>bak</i></td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td class="tdr">400</td>

<tr>
  <td>20 bak</td>

<tr>
  <td>20 pic</td>

<tr>

<tr>
  <td>20 kinchil</td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>one <i>alau</i></td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td class="tdr">64,000,000</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>This ancient system was obscured by the Spaniards using the word <i>pic</i>
to mean 1000 and <i>kinchil</i> to mean 1,000,000, instead of their original
significations.</p>

<p>The meaning of <i>kal</i>, I have already explained to be a fastening
together, a package, a bundle. <i>Bak</i>, as a verb, is to tie around and
around with a network of cords; <i>pic</i> is the old word for the short
petticoat worn by the women, which was occasionally used as a sac. If we
remember that grains of corn or of cacao were what were generally
employed as counters, then we may suppose these were measures of
quantity. The word <i>kal</i> (<i>qal</i>), in Kiche means a score and also
specifically 20 grains of cacao; <i>bak</i> in Cakchiquel means a corn-cob,
and as a verb to shell an ear of corn, but I am not clear of any
connection between this and the numeral. Other meanings of <i>bak</i> in Maya
are &#8220;meat&#8221; and the <i>partes pudendas</i> of either sex.</p>

<p><i>Calab</i>, seems to be an instrumental form from <i>cal</i>, to stuff, to fill
<span class="nowrap">full.<a name="FNanchor_45-1_31" id="FNanchor_45-1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_45-1_31" class="fnanchor">45-1</a></span> The word <i>calam</i> is used in the sense of excessive,
overmuch. In Cakchi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>quel the phrase <i>mani hu cala</i>, not (merely) one
<i>cala</i>, is synonymous with <i>mani hu chuvi</i>, not (merely) one bag or
sack, both meaning a countless <span class="nowrap">number.<a name="FNanchor_46-1_32" id="FNanchor_46-1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_46-1_32" class="fnanchor">46-1</a></span> In that dialect the
specific meaning of <i>cala</i> is 20 loads of cacao <span class="nowrap">beans.<a name="FNanchor_46-2_33" id="FNanchor_46-2_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_46-2_33" class="fnanchor">46-2</a></span></p>

<p>The term <i>tzotzceh</i> means deerskin, but for <i>kinchil</i> and <i>alau</i>, I have
found no satisfactory derivation that does not strain the forms of the
word too much. I would, however, suggest one possible connection of
meaning.</p>

<p>In <i>kinchil</i>, we have the word <i>kin</i>, day; in <i>alau</i>, the word <i>u</i>
month, and in the term for mathematical infinity, <i>hunhablat</i>, we find
<i>hun haab</i>, one year, just as in the related expression, <i>hunhablazic</i>,
which signifies that which lasts a whole year. If this suggestion is
well grounded, then in these highest expressions of quantity (and I am
inclined to think that originally <i>hun hablat</i>, one <i>hablat</i>=20 <i>alau</i>)
we have applications of the three time periods, the day, the month, and
the year, with the figurative sense that the increase of one over the
other was as the relative lengths of these different periods.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>I think it worth while to go into these etymologies, as they may throw
some light on the graphic representation of the numerals in the Maya
hieroglyphics. It is quite likely that the figures chosen to represent
the different higher units would resemble the objects which their names
literally signify. The first nineteen numerals were written by a
combination of dots and lines, examples of which we find in abundance in
the Codex Troano and other manuscripts. The following explanation of it
is from the pen of a native writer in the last century:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;They (our ancestors) used (for numerals in their calendars) dots and
lines back of them; one dot for one year, two dots for two years, three
dots for three, four dots for four, and so on; in addition to these they
used a line; one line meant five years, two lines ten years; if one line
and above it one dot, six years; if two dots above the line, seven
years; if three dots above, eight; if four dots above the line, nine; a
dot above two lines, eleven; if two dots, twelve; if three dots,
<span class="nowrap">thirteen.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_48-1_34" id="FNanchor_48-1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_48-1_34" class="fnanchor">48-1</a></span></p>

<p>The plan of using the numerals in Maya differs somewhat from that in
English.</p>

<p>In the first place, they are rarely named without the addition of a
<i>numeral particle</i>, which is suffixed. These particles indicate the
character or class of the objects which are, or are about to be,
enumerated. When they are uttered, the hearer at once knows what kind of
objects are to be spoken of. Many of them can be traced to a meaning
which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>has a definite application to a class, and they have analogues in
European tongues. Thus I may say &#8220;seven head of&#8221;&mdash;and the hearer knows
that I am going to speak of cattle, or sheep, or cabbages, or similar
objects usually counted by heads. So in Maya <i>ac</i> means a turtle or a
turtle shell; hence it is used as a particle in counting canoes, houses,
stools, vases, pits, caves, altars, and troughs, and some general
appropriateness can be seen; but when it is applied also to cornfields,
the analogy seems remote.</p>

<p>Of these numeral particles, not less than <i>seventy-six</i> are given by
Beltran, in his Grammar, and he does not exhaust the list. Of these
<i>piz</i> and <i>pel</i>, both of which mean, single, singly, are used in
counting years, and will frequently recur in the annals I present in
this volume.</p>

<p>By their aid another method of numeration was in vogue for counting
time. For &#8220;eighty-one years,&#8221; they did not say <i>hutuyokal haab</i>, but
<i>can kal haab catac hunpel haab</i>, literally, &#8220;four score years and one
year.&#8221; The copulative <i>catac</i> is also used in adding a smaller number to
a <i>bak</i>, or 400, as for 450, <i>hun bak catac lahuyoxkal</i>, &#8220;one <i>bak</i> and
ten toward the third score.&#8221; <i>Catac</i> is a compound of <i>ca tac</i>, <i>ca</i>
meaning &#8220;then&#8221; or &#8220;and,&#8221; and <i>tac</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>which Dr. Berendt considered to be
an irregular future of <i>talel</i>, to come, &#8220;then will come fifty,&#8221; but
which may be the imperative of <i>tac</i> (<i>tacah</i>, <i>tace</i>, third
conjugation), which means to put something under another, as in the
phrase <i>tac ex che yalan cum</i>, put you wood under the pot.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the latter method is by addition, the former by
subtraction. Another variety of the latter is found in the annals. For
instance, &#8220;ninety-nine years&#8221; is not expressed by <i>bolonlahutuyokal
haab</i>, nor yet by <i>cankal haab catac bolonlahunpel haab</i>, but by <i>hunpel
haab minan ti hokal haab</i>, &#8220;one single year lacking from five score
years.&#8221;</p>


<p class="sectionhead">&sect; 7. <i>The Calendar.</i></p>

<p>The system of computing time adopted by the Mayas is a subject too
extensive to be treated here in detail, but it is indispensable, for the
proper understanding of their annals, that the outlines of their
chronological scheme be explained.</p>

<p>The year, <i>haab</i>, was intended to begin on the day of the transit of the
sun by the zenith, and was counted from July 16th. It was divided into
eighteen months, <i>u</i> (<i>u</i>, month, moon), of twenty <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>days, <i>kin</i> (sun,
day, time), each. The days were divided into groups of five, as

<p>As the Maya year was of 365 days, and as 18 months of 20 days each
counted only 360 days, there were five days intervening between the last
of the month Cumku and the first day of the following year. These were
called &#8220;days without names,&#8221; <i>xma kaba kin</i> (<i>xma</i>, without, <i>kaba</i>,
names, <i>kin</i>, days), an expression not quite correct, as they were named
in regular order, only they were not counted in any month.</p>

<p>It will be seen, by glancing at the list of days, that this arrangement
brought at the beginning of each year, the days Kan, Muluc, Ix and Cauac
in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>turn, and that no other days could begin the year. These days were
therefore called <i>cuch haab</i>, &#8220;the bearers of the years&#8221; (<i>cuch</i>, to
bear, carry, <i>haab</i>, year), and years were distinguished as &#8220;a year
Kan,&#8221; &#8220;a year Muluc,&#8221; etc., as they began with one or another of these
&#8220;year bearers.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the calendar was not so simple as this. The days were not counted
from one to twenty, and then beginning at one again, and so on, but by
periods of 13 days each. Thus, in the first month, beginning with 1 Kan,
the 14th day of that month begins a new &#8220;week,&#8221; as it has been called,
and is named 1 Caban. Twenty-eight of these weeks make 364 days, thus
leaving one day to complete the year. When the number of these odd days
amounted to 13, in other words when thirteen years had elapsed, this
formed a period which was called &#8220;the <i>katun</i> of days,&#8221; <i>kin katun</i>, and
by Spanish writers an &#8220;indiction.&#8221;</p>

<p>It will be readily observed by an inspection of the following table,
that four of these indictions, in other words 52 years, will elapse
before a &#8220;year bearer&#8221; of the same name and number recommences a year.</p>

<p>A cycle of 52 years was thus obtained in a manner almost identical with
that of the Aztecs, Tarascos and other nations.</p>

<p>But the Mayas took an important step in advance of all their
contemporaries in arranging a much longer cycle.</p>

<p>This long cycle was an application of the vigesimal system to their
reckoning of time. Twenty days were a month, <i>u</i> or <i>uinal</i>; twenty
years was a cycle, <i>katun</i>. To ask one&#8217;s age the question was put
<i>haypel u katunil</i>? How many katuns have you? And the answer was,
<i>hunpel katun</i>, one katun (twenty years), or, <i>hopel in katunil</i>, I am
five katuns, or a hundred years old, as the case might be.</p>

<p>The division of the katuns was on the principle <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>of the Beltran system of
numeration (see page <a href="#Page_40">40</a>), as,</p>

<table width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td style="width: 50%"><i>xel u ca katun</i>,</td>
  <td style="width: 50%">thirty years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>xel u yox katun</i>,      </td>
  <td>fifty years.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">Literally these expressions are, &#8220;dividing the second katun,&#8221; &#8220;dividing
the third katun,&#8221; <i>xel</i> meaning to cut in pieces, to divide as with a
knife. They may be compared to the German <i>dritthalb</i>, two and a half,
or &#8220;the third a <span class="nowrap">half.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_54-1_35" id="FNanchor_54-1_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_54-1_35" class="fnanchor">54-1</a></span></p>

<p>The Katun of 20 years was divided into five lesser divisions of 4 years
each, called <i>tzuc</i>, a word with a signification something like the
English &#8220;bunch,&#8221; and which came to be used as a numeral particle in
counting parts, divisions, paragraphs, reasons, groups of towns,
<span class="nowrap">etc.<a name="FNanchor_54-2_36" id="FNanchor_54-2_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_54-2_36" class="fnanchor">54-2</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>These <i>tzuc</i> were called by the Spaniards <i>lustros</i>, from the Latin
<i>lustrum</i>, although that was a period <i>five</i> years. Cogolludo says:
&#8220;They counted their eras and ages, which they entered in their books, by
periods of 20 years each, and by <i>lustros</i> of four years each. The first
year they placed in the East [that is, on the Katun-wheel, and in the
figures in their books], calling it <i>cuch haab</i>; the second in the West,
called <i>Hijx</i>; the third in the South, <i>Cavac</i>; and the fourth, Muluc,
in the North, and this served them for the Dominical letter. When five
of the <i>lustros</i> had passed, that is 20 years, they called it a <i>Katun</i>,
and they placed one carved stone upon another, cemented with lime and
sand, in the walls of their temples, or in the houses of their
<span class="nowrap">priests.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_55-1_37" id="FNanchor_55-1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_55-1_37" class="fnanchor">55-1</a></span></p>

<p>The historian is wrong in saying that the first year was called
<i>cuchhaab</i>; that was the name applied to all the Dominical days, and as
I have said, means &#8220;year bearer.&#8221; The first year was called <i>Kan</i>, from
the first day of its first month.</p>

<p>This is but one of many illustrations of how cautious we must be in
accepting any statement of the early Spanish writers about the usages of
the natives.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>There is, however, some obscurity about the length of the <i>Katun</i>. All
the older Spanish writers, without exception, and most of the native
manuscripts, speak of it distinctly as a period of twenty years. Yet
there are three manuscripts of high authority in the Maya which state
that it embraced twenty-four years, although the last four were not
reckoned. This theory was adopted and warmly advocated by Pio Perez, in
his essay on the ancient chronology of Yucatan, and is also borne out by
calculations which have been made on the hieroglyphic Codex Troano, by
M. Delaporte, in France, and Professor Cyrus Thomas, in the United
<span class="nowrap">States.<a name="FNanchor_56-1_38" id="FNanchor_56-1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_56-1_38" class="fnanchor">56-1</a></span></p>

<p>This discrepancy may arise from the custom of counting the katuns by two
different systems, ground for which supposition is furnished by various
manuscripts; but for purposes of chronology and ordinary life, it will
be evident that the writers of the annals in the present volume adopted
the Katun of twenty years&#8217; length; while on the other hand the native
Pech, in his History of the Conquest, which is the last piece in the
volume, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>gives for the beginning and the end of the Katun the years
1517-1541, and therefore must have had in mind one of twenty-four years&#8217;
duration. The solution of these contradictions is not yet at hand.</p>

<p>This great cycle of 13&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;20=260 years was called an <i>ahau Katun</i>
collectively, and each period in it bore the same name.</p>

<p>This name, <i>ahau Katun</i>, deserves careful analysis. <i>Ahau</i> is the
ordinary word for chief, king, ruler. It is probably a compound of <i>ah</i>,
which is the male prefix and sign of the <i>nomen agentis</i>, and <i>u</i>,
collar, a collar of gold or other precious substance, distinguishing the
chiefs. <i>Katun</i> has been variously analyzed. Don Pio Perez supposed it
was a compound of <i>kat</i>, to ask, and <i>tun</i>, a stone, because at the
close of these periods they set up the sculptured stone, which was
afterwards referred to in order to fix the dates of <span class="nowrap">occurrences.<a name="FNanchor_57-1_39" id="FNanchor_57-1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_57-1_39" class="fnanchor">57-1</a></span>
This, however, would certainly require that <i>kat</i> be in the passive,
<i>katal</i> or <i>kataan</i>, and would give <i>katantun</i>. Beltran in his Grammar
treats the word as an adjective, meaning very long, <span class="nowrap">perpetual.<a name="FNanchor_57-2_40" id="FNanchor_57-2_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_57-2_40" class="fnanchor">57-2</a></span> But
this is a later, secondary sense. Its usual signification is a body or
<a name="corr7" id="corr7"></a><ins class="correction" title="battalion">batallion</ins> of war<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>riors engaged in action. As a verb, it is to
fight, to give battle, and thus seems related to the Cakchiquel
<img src="images/image02.png" width="10" height="25" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="tresillo" title="tresillo" /><i>at</i>, to cut, or wound, to make <span class="nowrap">prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_58-1_41" id="FNanchor_58-1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-1_41" class="fnanchor">58-1</a></span>
The series of years, ordered and arranged under a controlling day and
date, were like a row of soldiers commanded by a chief, and hence the
name <i>ahau katun</i>.</p>

<p>Each of these <i>ahaus</i> or chiefs of the Katuns was represented in the
native calendars by the picture or portrait of a particular personage
who in some way was identified with the Katun, and his name was given to
it. This has not been dwelt upon nor even mentioned by previous writers
on the subject, but I have copies of various native manuscripts which
illustrate it, and give the names of each of the rulers of the Katuns.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>The thirteen <i>ahau katuns</i> were not numbered from 1 upward, but
beginning at the 13th, by the alternate numbers, in the following
order:&mdash;</p>

<p class="titlepage">13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2</p>

<p>Various reasons have been assigned for this arrangement. It would be
foreign to my purpose to discuss them here, and I shall merely quote the
following, from a paper I wrote on the subject, printed in the <i>American
Naturalist</i>, Sept., 1881:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Gallatin explained them as the numerical characters of the days
&#8220;Ahau&#8221; following the first day of each year called Cauac; Dr.
Valentini thinks they refer to the numbers of the various idols
worshiped in the different Ahaus; Professor Thomas that they are
the number of the year (in the indiction of 52 years) on which the
Ahau begins. Each of these statements is true in itself, but each
fails to show any practical use of the series; and of the last
mentioned it is to be observed that the objection applies to it
that at the commencement of an Ahau Katun the numbers would run 1,
12, 10, 8, etc., whereas we know positively that the numbers of the
Ahaus began with 13 and continued 11, 9, 7, 5, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;The explanation which I offer is that the number of the Ahau was
taken from the last day Cauac preceding the Kan with which the
first year of each Ahau began&mdash;for, as 24 is divisible by 4, the
first year of each Ahau necessarily began with the day Kan. This
number was the &#8220;ruling number&#8221; of the Ahau, and not for any
mystical or ceremonial purpose, but for the practical one of at
once and easily converting any year designated in the Ahau into its
equivalent in the current <span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 100%;"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Kin Katun, or 52 year cycle. All that is
necessary to do this is, to <i>add the number of the year in the Ahau
to the number of the year Cauac corresponding to this &#8220;ruling
number.&#8221; When the sum exceeds 52, subtract that number.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Take an example: To what year in the Kin Katun does 10 Ahau <span class="smcap">XI</span>
(the 10th year of the 11th Ahau) correspond?</p>

<p>&#8220;On referring to a table, or, as the Mayas did, to a &#8216;Katun wheel,&#8217;
we find the 11th Cauac to be the 24th year of the cycle; add ten to
this and we have 34 as the number of the year in the cycle to which
10 Ahau <span class="smcap">XI</span> corresponds. The great simplicity and convenience of
this will be evident without further discussion.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The important question remains, how closely, by these cycles, did the
Mayas approximate to preserving the exact date of an event?</p>

<p>To answer this fairly, we should be sure that we have a perfectly
authentic translation of their hieroglyphic annals. It is doubtful that
we have. Those I present in this volume are the most perfect, so far as
I know, but they certainly do not agree among themselves. Can their
discrepancies be explained? I think they can in a measure (1) by the
differing length of the katuns, (2) by the era assumed as the
commencement of the reckoning.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that there was apparently no common era adopted by
the Mayas; each province may have selected its own; and it is quite
erroneous to condemn the annals off-hand <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>for inaccuracy because they
conflict between themselves.</p>


<p class="sectionhead">&sect; 8. <i>Ancient Hieroglyphic Books.</i></p>

<p>The Mayas were a literary people. They made frequent use of tablets,
wrote many books, and covered the walls of their buildings with
hieroglyphic signs, cut in the stones or painted upon the plaster.</p>

<p>The explanation of these signs is one of the leading problems in
American arch&aelig;ology. It was supposed to have been solved when the
manuscript of Bishop Landa&#8217;s account of Yucatan was discovered, some
twenty years ago, in Madrid. The Bishop gave what he called &#8220;an A, B,
C,&#8221; of the language, but which, when applied to the extant manuscripts
and the mural inscriptions, proved entirely insufficient to decipher
them.</p>

<p>The disappointment of the antiquaries was great, and by one of them, Dr.
Felipe Valentini, Landa&#8217;s alphabet has been denounced as &#8220;a Spanish
<span class="nowrap">fabrication.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_61-1_42" id="FNanchor_61-1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_61-1_42" class="fnanchor">61-1</a></span> But certainly any one acquainted with the history of
the Latin alphabet, how it required the labor of thousands of years and
the demands of three wholly different families of languages, to bring it
to its perfection, should not have looked to find among the Mayas, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>anywhere else, a parallel production of human intelligence. Moreover,
rightly understood, Landa does not intimate anything of the kind. He
distinctly states that what he gives are the sounds of the Spanish
letters as they would be transcribed in Maya characters; not at all that
they analyzed the sounds of their words and expressed the phonetic
elements in these characters. On the contrary, he takes care to affirm
that they could not do this, and gives an example in <span class="nowrap">point.<a name="FNanchor_62-1_43" id="FNanchor_62-1_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_62-1_43" class="fnanchor">62-1</a></span> Dr.
Valentini, therefore, was attacking a windmill, and entirely
misconstrued the Bishop&#8217;s statements.</p>

<p>I shall not, in this connection, enter into a discussion of the nature
of these hieroglyphics. It is enough for my purpose to say that they
were recognized by the earliest Spanish explorers as quite different
from those of Mexico, and as the only graphic system on the continent,
so far as they knew it, which merited the name of <span class="nowrap">writing.<a name="FNanchor_62-2_44" id="FNanchor_62-2_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_62-2_44" class="fnanchor">62-2</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>The word for book in Maya is <i>huun</i>, a monosyllable which reappears in
the Kiche <i>vuh</i> and the Huasteca <i>uuh</i>. In Maya this initial <i>h</i> is
almost silent and is occasionally dropped, as <i>yuunil Dios</i>, the book of
God (syncopated form of <i>u huunil Dios</i>, the suffix <i>il</i> being the
&#8220;determinative&#8221; ending). I am inclined to believe that <i>huun</i> is merely
a form of <i>uoohan</i>, something written, this being the passive participle
of <i>uooh</i>, to write, which, as a noun, also means a character, a
<span class="nowrap">letter.<a name="FNanchor_63-1_45" id="FNanchor_63-1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_63-1_45" class="fnanchor">63-1</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>Another name for their books, especially those containing the prophecies
and forecasts of the priestly diviners, is said to have been <i>anahte</i>;
or <i>analte</i>. This word is not to be found in any of the early
dictionaries. The usual authority for it is Villagutierre Sotomayor, who
describes these volumes as they were seen among the Itzas of Lake Peten,
about <span class="nowrap">1690.<a name="FNanchor_64-1_46" id="FNanchor_64-1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_64-1_46" class="fnanchor">64-1</a></span></p>

<p>These books consisted of one long sheet of a kind of paper made by
macerating and beating together the leaves of the maguey, and afterwards
sizing the surface with a durable white varnish. The sheet was folded
like a screen, forming pages about 9&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5 inches. Both sides were covered
with figures and characters painted in various brilliant colors. On the
outer pages boards were fastened, for protection, so that the completed
volume had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>the appearance of a bound book of large octavo size.</p>

<p>Instead of this paper, parchment was sometimes used. This was made from
deerskins, thoroughly cured and also smoked, so that they should be less
liable to the attacks of insects. A very durable substance was thus
obtained, which would resist most agents of destruction, even in a
tropical climate. Twenty-seven rolls of such parchment, covered with
hieroglyphics, were among the articles burned by Bishop Landa, at Mani,
in 1562, in a general destruction of everything which related to the
ancient life of the nation. He himself says that he burned all that he
could lay his hands upon, to the great distress of the <span class="nowrap">natives.<a name="FNanchor_65-1_47" id="FNanchor_65-1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_65-1_47" class="fnanchor">65-1</a></span></p>

<p>A very few escaped the destructive bigotry of the Spanish priests. So
far as known these are.&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Codex Tro, or Troano, in Madrid, published by the French
government, in 1869.</p>

<p>2. What is believed to be the second part of the Codex Troano, now
(1882) in process of publication in Paris.</p>

<p>3. The Codex Peresianus, in the National Library, Paris, a very limited
edition of which has been issued.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>4. The Dresden Codex, in Kingsborough&#8217;s Mexico, and photographed in
colors, to the number of 50 copies, in 1880, which is believed to
contain fragments of two different manuscripts.</p>

<p>To these are, perhaps, to be added one other in Europe and two in
Mexico, which are in private hands, and are alleged to be of the same
character.</p>

<p>All the above are distinctly in characters which were peculiar to the
Mayas, and which are clearly variants of those found on the sculptured
beams and slabs of Uxmal, Chichen Itza, Palenque and Copan.</p>

<p>It is possible that many other manuscripts may be discovered in time,
for Landa tells us that it was the custom to bury with the priests the
books which they had written. As their tombs were at times of solid
stones, firmly cemented together, and well calculated to resist the
moisture and other elements of destruction for centuries, it is nowise
unlikely that explorations in Yucatan will bring to light some of these
hidden documents.</p>

<p>The contents of these books, so far as we can judge from the hints in
the early writers, related chiefly to the ritual and calendar, to their
history or Katuns, to astrological predictions and divinations, to their
mythology, and to their system of healing disease.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&sect; 9. <i>Modern Maya Manuscripts.</i></p>

<p>As I have said, the Mayas were naturally a literary people. Had they
been offered the slightest chance for the cultivation of their
intellects they would have become a nation of readers and writers.
Striking testimony to this effect is offered by Doctor Don Augustin de
Echano, Prebend of the Cathedral Church of Merida, about the middle of
the last century. He observes that twelve years of experience among the
Indians had taught him that they were very desirous of knowledge, and
that as soon as they learned to read, they eagerly perused everything
they could lay their hands on; and as they had nothing in their tongue
but some old writings that treated of sorceries and quackeries, the
worthy Prebend thought it an excellent idea that they should be
supplied, in place of these, with some &mdash;&mdash; <span class="nowrap"><i>sermons</i>!<a name="FNanchor_67-1_48" id="FNanchor_67-1_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_67-1_48" class="fnanchor">67-1</a></span> But what
else could be expected of a body of men who crushed out with equal
bigotry every spark of mental independence in their own country?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>The &#8220;old writings&#8221; to which the Prebend alludes were composed by natives
who had learned to write the Maya in the alphabet adopted by the early
missionaries and conquerors. An official document in Maya, still extant,
dates from 1542, and from that time on there were natives who wrote
their tongue with fluency. But their favorite compositions were works
similar to those to which their forefathers had been partial,
prophecies, chronicles and medical treatises.</p>

<p>Relying on their memories, and no doubt aided by some of the ancient
hieroglyphical manuscripts, carefully secreted from the vandalism of the
monks, they wrote out what they could recollect of their national
literature.</p>

<p>There were at one time a large number of these records. They are
referred to by Cogolludo, Sanchez Aguilar and other early historians.
Probably nearly every village had one, which in time became to be
regarded with superstitious veneration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>Wherever written, each of these books bore the same name; it was always
referred to as &#8220;The Book of Chilan Balam.&#8221; To distinguish them apart,
the name of the village where one was composed was added. Thus we have
still preserved to us, in whole or in fragments, the Book of Chilan
Balam of Chumayel, of Kaua, of Nabula, etc., in all, it is said, about
sixteen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chilan Balam&#8221; was the designation of a class of priests. &#8220;Chilan,&#8221; says
Bishop Landa, &#8220;was the name of their priests, whose duty it was to teach
the sciences, to appoint holy days, to treat the sick, to offer
sacrifices, and especially to utter the oracles of the gods. They were
so highly honored by the people that usually they were carried on
litters on the shoulders of the <span class="nowrap">devotees.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_69-1_49" id="FNanchor_69-1_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_69-1_49" class="fnanchor">69-1</a></span> Strictly speaking, in
Maya, <i>chilan</i> means &#8220;interpreter,&#8221; &#8220;mouth-piece,&#8221; from &#8220;<i>chij</i>,&#8221; &#8220;the
mouth,&#8221; and in this ordinary sense frequently occurs in other writings.
The word <i>balam</i>&mdash;literally, &#8220;tiger,&#8221;&mdash;was also applied to a class of
priests, and is still in use among the natives of Yucatan as the
designation of the protective spirits of fields and towns, as I have
shown at length in a study of the word <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>as it occurs in the native myths
of <span class="nowrap">Guatemala.<a name="FNanchor_70-1_50" id="FNanchor_70-1_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_70-1_50" class="fnanchor">70-1</a></span> &#8220;<i>Chilan Balam</i>,&#8221; therefore, is not a proper name,
but a title, and in ancient times designated the priest who announced
the will of the gods and explained the sacred oracles. This accounts for
the universality of the name and the sacredness of its associations.</p>

<p>The dates of the books which have come down to us are various. One of
them, &#8220;The Book of Chilan Balam of Mani,&#8221; was undoubtedly composed not
later than 1595, as is proved by internal evidence. Various passages in
the works of Landa, Lizana, Sanchez Aguilar and Cogolludo&mdash;all early
historians of Yucatan&mdash;prove that many of these native manuscripts
existed in the sixteenth century. Several rescripts date from the
seventeenth century&mdash;most from the latter half of the eighteenth.</p>

<p>The names of the writers are generally not given, probably because the
books, as we have them, are all copies of older manuscripts, with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>merely
the occasional addition of current items of note by the copyist; as, for
instance, a malignant epidemic which prevailed in the peninsula in 1673
is mentioned as a present occurrence by the copyist of &#8220;The Book of
Chilan Balam of Nabula.&#8221;</p>

<p>These &#8220;Books of Chilan Balam&#8221; are the principal sources from which Se&ntilde;or
Pio Perez derived his knowledge of the ancient Maya system of computing
time, and also drew what he published concerning the history of the
Mayas before the Conquest, and from them also are taken the various
chronicles which I present in the present volume.</p>

<p>That I am enabled to do so is due to the untiring researches of Dr. Carl
Hermann Berendt, who visited Yucatan four times, in order to study the
native language, to examine the antiquities of the peninsula, and to
take accurate copies, often in fac-simile, of as many ancient
manuscripts as he could discover. After his death, his collection came
into my hands.</p>

<p>The task of deciphering these manuscripts is by no means a light one,
and I must ask in advance for considerable indulgence for my attempt.
Words and phrases are used which are not explained in the dictionaries,
or, if explained, are used in a different sense from that now current.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>The orthography is far from uniform, each syllable is often written
separately, and as the punctuation is wholly fanciful or entirely
absent, the separation of words, sentences and paragraphs is often
uncertain and the meaning obscure.</p>

<p>Another class of documents are the titles to the municipal lands, the
records of surveys, etc. I have copies of several of these, and among
them was found the history of the Conquest, by Nakuk Pech, which I
publish. It was added to the survey of his town, as a general statement
of his rights and defence of the standing of his family.</p>

<p>My translations are not in flowing and elegant language. Had they been
so, they would not have represented the originals. For the sake of
accuracy I have not hesitated to sacrifice the requirements of English
composition.</p>


<p class="sectionhead">&sect; 10. <i>Grammars and Dictionaries of the Language.</i></p>

<p>The learned Yucatecan, Canon Crescencio Carillo y Ancona, states in his
last work that there have been written thirteen grammars and seventeen
dictionaries of the <span class="nowrap">Maya.<a name="FNanchor_72-1_51" id="FNanchor_72-1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_72-1_51" class="fnanchor">72-1</a></span></p>

<p>The first grammar printed was that of Father Luis de Villalpando. This
early missionary died in 1551 or 1552, and his work was not issued until
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>some years later. Father Juan Coronel also gave a short Maya grammar to
the press, together with a <i>Doctrina</i>. It is believed that copies of
both of these are preserved. Beltran, however, acknowledges that in
preparing his own grammar he has never seen either of these earlier
<span class="nowrap">works.<a name="FNanchor_73-1_52" id="FNanchor_73-1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_73-1_52" class="fnanchor">73-1</a></span></p>

<p>In 1684, the <i>Arte de la Lengua Maya</i>, composed by Father Gabriel de San
Buenaventura, a French Franciscan stationed in Yucatan, was printed in
<span class="nowrap">Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_73-2_53" id="FNanchor_73-2_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_73-2_53" class="fnanchor">73-2</a></span> Only a few copies of this work are known. It has, however,
been reprinted, though not with a desirable fidelity, by the Abbe
Brasseur (de Bourbourg), in the second volume of the reports of the
<i>Mission Scientifique au Mexique et &agrave; l&#8217;Amerique Centrale</i>, Paris, 1870.</p>

<p>The leading authority on Maya grammar is Father Pedro Beltran, who was a
native of Yucatan, and instructor in the Maya language in the convent of
Merida about 1740. He was thoroughly conversant with the native tongue,
and his <i>Arte</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>was reprinted in Merida, in 1859, as the best work of the
kind which had been <span class="nowrap">produced.<a name="FNanchor_74-1_54" id="FNanchor_74-1_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_74-1_54" class="fnanchor">74-1</a></span></p>

<p>The eminent antiquary, Don Juan Pio Perez contemplated writing a Maya
grammar, and collected a number of notes for that <span class="nowrap">purpose,<a name="FNanchor_74-2_55" id="FNanchor_74-2_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_74-2_55" class="fnanchor">74-2</a></span> as did
also the late Dr. Berendt, but neither brought his work to any degree of
completeness. I have copies of the notes left by both these diligent
students, as also both editions of Beltran, and an accurate MS. copy of
Buenaventura, from all of which I have derived assistance in completing
the present study.</p>

<p>The first Maya dictionary printed was issued in the City of Mexico in
1571. It was published as that of Father Luis de Villalpando, but as he
had then been dead nearly twenty years, it was probably merely based
upon his vocabulary. It was in large 4to, of the same size as the second
edition of Molina&#8217;s <i>Vocabulario de la Lengua Mexicana</i>. At least one
copy of it is known to be in existence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>For more than three centuries no other dictionary was put to press,
although for some unexplained reason that of Villalpando was unknown in
Yucatan. At length, in 1877, the publication was completed at M&eacute;rida, of
the <i>Diccionario de la Lengua Maya</i>, by Don Juan Pio <span class="nowrap">Perez.<a name="FNanchor_75-1_56" id="FNanchor_75-1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_75-1_56" class="fnanchor">75-1</a></span> It
contains about 20,000 words, and is Maya-Spanish only. It is the result
of a conscientious and lifelong study of the language, and a work of
great merit. The deficiencies it presents are, that it does not give the
principal parts of the verbs, that it omits or does not explain
correctly many old terms in the language, and that it gives very few
examples of idioms or phrases showing the uses of words and the
construction of sentences.</p>

<p>I can say little in praise of the <i>Vocabulaire Maya-Francais-Espagnole</i>,
compiled by the Abb&eacute; Brasseur (de Bourbourg), and printed in the second
volume of the Report of the <i>Mission Scientifique au Mexique et &agrave;
l&#8217;Amerique Centrale</i>. It contains about ten thousand words, but many of
these are drawn from doubtful sources, and are incorrectly given; while
the derivations and anal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>ogies proposed are of a character unknown to the
science of language.</p>

<p>Besides the above and various vocabularies of minor interest, I have
made use of three manuscript dictionaries of the first importance, which
were obtained by the late Dr. Berendt. They belonged to three Franciscan
convents which formerly existed in Yucatan, and as they are all
anonymous, I shall follow Dr. Berendt&#8217;s example, and refer to them by
the names of the convents to which they belonged. These were the convent
of San Francisco in Merida, that at the town of Ticul and that at Motul.</p>

<p>The most recent of these is that of the convent of Ticul. It bears the
date 1690, and is in two parts, Spanish-Maya and Maya-Spanish.</p>

<p>The <i>Diccionario del Convento de San Francisco de Merida</i> bears no date,
but in the opinion of the most competent scholars who have examined it,
among them Se&ntilde;or Pio Perez, it is older than that of Ticul, probably by
half a century. It is also in two parts, which have evidently been
prepared, by different hands.</p>

<p><i>The Diccionario del Convento de Motul</i> is by far the most valuable of
the three, and has not been known to Yucatecan scholars. A copy of it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>was picked up on a book stall in the City of Mexico by the Abb&eacute;
Brasseur, and sold by him to Mr. John Carter Brown, of Providence, R.&nbsp;I.
In 1864 this was very carefully copied by Dr. Berendt, who also made
extensive additions to it from other sources, indicating such by the use
of inks of different colors. This copy, in three large quarto volumes,
in all counting over 2500 pages, is that which I now have, and have
found of indispensable assistance in solving some of the puzzles
presented by the ancient texts in the present volume.</p>

<p>The particular value of the <i>Diccionario de Motul</i> is not merely the
richness of its vocabulary and its numerous examples of construction,
but that it presents the language as it was when the Spaniards first
arrived. The precise date of its compilation is indeed not given, but
the author speaks of a comet which he saw in 1577, and gives other
evidence that he was writing in the first generation after the Conquest.</p>

to Fort, this meant &#8220;origin and beginning,&#8221; in the ancient language of

cccc pi&eacute;s que llaman <i>hun-uinic</i>, medida con vara de XX pies, XX en
ancho y XX en largo.&#8221; The agrarian measure <i>uinic</i> or <i>hun uinic</i> (one
man) contained 20 <i>kaan</i>, each 24 yards (<i>varas</i>) square. One <i>kaan</i> was
estimated to yield two loads of corn, and hence the calculation was
forty loads of the staff of life for each family. Landa&#8217;s statement that
a patch 20 feet square was assigned to a family is absurd on the face of
it.</p></div>

Father Alonso Ponce, the Pope&#8217;s Commissary-General, who traveled through
Yucatan in 1586, when many natives were still living who had been born
before the Conquest (1541). Father Ponce had traveled through Mexico,
and, of course, had learned about the Aztec picture-writing, which he
distinctly contrasts with the writing of the Mayas. Of the latter he
says: &#8220;Son alabados de tres cosas entre todos los demas de la Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, la una de que en su antiguedad tenian caracteres y letras, con
que escribian sus historias y las ceremonias y orden de los sacrificios
de sus idolos y su calendario, en libros hechos de corteza de cierto
arbol, los cuales eran unas tiras muy largas de quarta &oacute; tercia en
ancho, que se doblaban y recogian, y venia &aacute; queder &aacute; manera de un libro
encuardenada en cuartilla, poco mas, &oacute; menos. Estas letras y caracteres
no las entendian, sino los sacerdotes de los idolos, (que en aquella
lengua se llaman &#8216;ahkines&#8217;), y algun indio principal. Despues las
entendieron y supieron l&eacute;er algunos frailes nuestros y aun las
escribien.&#8221; (<i>Relacion Breve y Verdadera de Algunas Cosas de las Muchas

makes the interesting statement that these characters were actually used
by missionaries to impart instruction to the natives.</p></div>

<h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="THE_CHRONICLES" id="THE_CHRONICLES"></a>THE CHRONICLES.</h2>

<hr class="chapopen" />

<p>The chronicles and fragments of chronicles which I have collected here
are all taken from the various &#8220;Books of Chilan Balam.&#8221; They constitute
about all that remains to us, so far as I know, of the ancient history
of the peninsula. There are, indeed, in other portions of these &#8220;Books&#8221;
references to historical events before the Conquest, but no other
consecutive narrations of them.</p>

<p>Except the one given first, none of these has ever been printed, nor
even translated from the Maya into any European language. Whether they
corroborate or contradict one another, it is equally important for
American arch&aelig;ology to have them preserved and presented in their
original form.</p>

<p>It does not come within my present purpose to try to reconcile the
discrepancies between them. I am furnishing materials for history, not
writing it, and my chief duty is to observe accuracy, even at the risk
of depreciating the value of the documents I offer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>I have, therefore, followed strictly the manuscripts which I possess in
fac-similes of the originals, and when I believe the text is corrupt or
in error, I have suggested apart from the text what I suppose to be the
needed correction to the passage.</p>

<p>In the notes I have also discussed such grammatical or historical
questions as have occurred to me as of use in elucidating the text.</p>

<p>There will be found considerable repetition in these different versions,
as must necessarily be from their character, if they have a claim to be
authentic records; but it is also fair to add that details will be found
in each which are omitted in the others, and hence, that all are
valuable.</p>

<p>This similarity may be explained by two suppositions; either they are
copies from a common original, or they present the facts they narrate in
general formul&aelig; which had been widely adopted by the priests for
committing to memory their ancient history. The differences which we
find in them preclude the former hypothesis except as it may apply to
the first two. The similarities in the others I believe are no more than
would occur in relating the same incidents which had been learned
through fixed forms of narration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>The division into sections I have made for convenience of reference. The
variants I have given at the bottom of the page are readings which I
think are preferable to those in the text, or corrections of manifest
errors; but I have endeavored to give the text, just as it is in the
best MSS. I have, errors and all.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to enter into a critical historical analysis of
these chronicles. But a few remarks may be made to facilitate their
examination.</p>

<p>Making the necessary omissions in No. II, which I point out in the
prefatory note to it, it will be found that all five agree tolerably
well in the length of time they embrace. Nos. III and IV begin at a
later date than the others, but coincide as far as they go.</p>

<p>The total period of time, from the earliest date given, to the
settlement of the country by the Spaniards, is 71 katuns. If the katun
is estimated at twenty years, this equals 1420 years; if at twenty-four
years, then we have 1704 years.</p>

<p>All the native writers agree, and I think, in spite of the contrary
statement of Bishop Landa, that we may look upon it as beyond doubt,
that the last day of the 11th katun was July 15th, 1541. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>Therefore the
one of the above calculations would carry us back to A.&nbsp;D. 121, the
other to B.&nbsp;C. 173.</p>

<p>The chief possibility of error in the reckoning would be from confusing
the great cycles of 260 (or 312) years, one with another, and assigning
events to different cycles which really happened in the same. This would
increase the number of the cycles, and thus extend the period of time
they appear to cover. This has undoubtedly been done in No. II.</p>

<p>According to the reckoning as it now stands, six complete great cycles
were counted, and parts of two others, so that the native at the time of
the Conquest would have had eight great cycles to distinguish apart.</p>

<p>I have not found any clear explanation how this was accomplished. We do
not even know what name was given to this great cycle, nor whether the
calendar was sufficiently perfected to prevent confusion in dates in the
remote past.</p>

<p>I find, however, two passages in the collection of ancient manuscripts,
which I have before referred to as the <i>Codice Perez</i>, which seem to
have a bearing on this point; but as the text is somewhat corrupt and
several of the expressions <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>archaic, I am not certain that I catch the
right meaning. These passages are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>U hi&#596;il lahun ahau u &#596;ocol hun uu&#596; katun, u zut tucaten

<p class="titlepage"><i>Translation.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At the last of the tenth ahau katun is ended one doubling of the
katun, and the return a second time of thirteen katuns is written
on the face of the katun circle; one doubling of the katuns, as it
is called, will then finish its course, to begin again; and when it
begins, it is written that another katun commences: when the eighth
katun ends it begins again (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, to count with this eighth as
the first of the next &#8220;doubling&#8221;).</p>

<p>At the last of the tenth Ahau Katun is ended the joining together
of thirteen katuns (which is) written on the face of the katun
circle; one doubling of the katuns, as it is called, will then
finish its course, and another katun will begin and will end as the
eighth katun; this begins a second time, as it began (at first) and
was then written.</p></div>

<p>In other words, if I do not miss the writer&#8217;s meaning, the repetitions
of the great cycle of thirteen katuns were not counted from either of
its terminals, to wit, the thirteenth or the second katun, but from the
tenth katun. These repetitions were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>called <i>uu&#596; katun</i>, the doubling
or foldings over of the katuns, and they were inscribed on the circle or
wheel of the katuns at that part of it where the tenth katun was
entered. These wheels were called <i>u pet katun</i>, the circle of the
katuns, or <i>u met katun</i>, the wheel of the katuns, or <i>u uazaklom
katun</i>, the return of the katuns. I have several copies of them, and one
is given in Landa&#8217;s work, but I know of none which is a genuine
original, and, therefore, it is not surprising that I do not find on any
of them the signs referred to adjacent to the tenth katun.</p>

<p>For the convenience of the reader I have drawn up the following
chronological table of the events referred to in the Chronicles,
arranging them under the Great Cycles and Katuns to which they would
belong were the former numbered according to the regular sequence given
on page <a href="#Page_59">59</a>. I have also inserted the katuns which were omitted by the
native chroniclers, but which, according to that sequence, are necessary
in order to complete their records in accordance with the theory of the
Maya calendar. The references in Roman numerals are to the different
chronicles.</p>

<h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="I_THE_SERIES_OF_THE_KATUNS" id="I_THE_SERIES_OF_THE_KATUNS"></a>I. THE SERIES OF THE KATUNS.</h2>

<p class="titlepage"><i>From the Book of Chilan Balam of Mani.</i></p>

<hr class="chapopen" />


<p>The first chronicle which I present is the only one which has been
heretofore published. On account of its comparative fullness it deserves
especial attention. It is taken from the Book of Chilan Balam of the
town of Mani.</p>

<p>This town, according to a tradition preserved by Herrera, was founded
after the destruction of Mayapan, and, therefore, not more than seventy
years before the arrival of the Spaniards. Mayapan was destroyed in
consequence of a violent feud between the two powerful families who
jointly ruled there, the Cocoms and the Xius or Tutul Xius. The latter,
having slain all members of the Cocom family to be found in the city,
deserted its site and removed south about fifteen miles, and there
established as their capital a city to which they gave the name Mani,
&#8220;which means &#8216;it is past,&#8217; as if to say &#8216;let us start <span class="nowrap">anew.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_89-1_57" id="FNanchor_89-1_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_89-1_57" class="fnanchor">89-1</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>At the time of the Conquest the reigning chief of the Tutulxius was
friendly to the Spaniards, and voluntarily submitted to their rule, as
we are informed with much minuteness of detail by the historian
<span class="nowrap">Cogolludo.<a name="FNanchor_90-1_58" id="FNanchor_90-1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_90-1_58" class="fnanchor">90-1</a></span> We may reasonably suppose, therefore, that this
chronicle was brought from Mayapan in the &#8220;Books of Science,&#8221; which
Herrera refers to as esteemed their greatest treasure by the chiefs who
broke up their ancient confederation when Mayapan was deserted. Hence
the records ran a better chance of being preserved in this province than
in those which were desolated by war. As I have already said (page <a href="#Page_65">65</a>) a
large number were destroyed precisely at Mani by Bishop Landa, in 1562.</p>

<p>I find among the memoranda of Dr. Berendt <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>reference to four &#8220;Books of
Chilan Balam,&#8221; of Mani. These dated from 1689, 1697, 1755 and 1761,
respectively, but I have not learned from which of these Pio Perez
extracted the chronicles he gave Mr. John L. Stephens. Dr. Berendt adds
that it was from one which was in possession of a native schoolmaster of
Mani, who, having the surname Balam, claimed to be descended from the
original Chilan <span class="nowrap">Balam!<a name="FNanchor_91-1_59" id="FNanchor_91-1_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_91-1_59" class="fnanchor">91-1</a></span></p>

<p>The first publication of the document was in the Appendix to the second
volume of Mr. Stephens&#8217; <i>Incidents of Travel in Yucatan</i> (New York,
1843). It included the original Maya text, with a not very accurate
translation into English of Pio Perez&#8217;s rendering of the Maya. From Mr.
Stephen&#8217;s volume, the document has been copied into various publications
in Mexico, Yucatan and Europe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>The other attempt at an independent translation was that of the Abb&eacute;
Brasseur (de Bourbourg), published at Paris in 1864, in the same volume
with Landa&#8217;s <i>Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan</i>. The text he took from
Stephens&#8217; book, errors and omissions included, and his translation is
entirely based on the English one, as he evidently did not have access
to the original Spanish of Pio Perez.</p>

<p>The most important recent study of the subject has been made by Dr.
Valentini, who published the notes of Pio Perez on his translation, and
gave a general re-examination of ancient Maya history, with a great deal
of sagacity and a large acquaintance with the related Spanish
<span class="nowrap">literature.<a name="FNanchor_92-1_60" id="FNanchor_92-1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_92-1_60" class="fnanchor">92-1</a></span> He is, however, in error in stating that he was the
first to publish the notes of Perez, as they had previously been printed
in a work by Canon <span class="nowrap">Carrillo.<a name="FNanchor_92-2_61" id="FNanchor_92-2_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_92-2_61" class="fnanchor">92-2</a></span></p>

<p>Much use of this chronicle has been made by the recent historians of
Yucatan, Don Eligio Ancona <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>and the Canon Crescencio Carrillo y Ancona;
but I am surprised to find that they have depended entirely on the
previous labors of Pio Perez, Stephens and Brasseur, and have made no
attempt to verify or extend them.</p>

<p>Dr. Berendt, although earnestly devoted to collecting and copying these
records did not, as Dr. Valentini observes, ever attempt a translation
of any of them.</p>

<p>No hint is given as to the author of the document, nor do we know from
what sources he derived his information. It has been plausibly suggested
that it was an epitome of the history of their nations, which was
learned by heart and handed down from master to disciple, and which
served as a verbal key to the interpretation of the painted and
sculptured records, and to the &#8220;katun stones&#8221; which were erected at the
expiration of each cycle and inscribed with the principal events which
had transpired in it.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Brasseur placed at the head of his edition of this chronicle
the title, in Maya:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Lelo lai u tzolan katunil ti Mayab,&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="noindent">which he translates&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;S&eacute;ries des Epoques de l&#8217;Histoire Maya.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>This is an invention of the learned antiquary. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>There is no such nor any
other title to the original. It is simply called in the first line <i>u
tzolan katun</i>, the arrangement or order of the katuns. The word <i>tzolan</i>
is a verbal noun, the past participle of the passive voice of <i>tzol</i>,
which means to put in order, to arrange, and is in the genitive of the
thing possessed, as indicated by the pronoun <i>u</i>. Literally, the phrase
reads, &#8220;their arrangement (the) katuns.&#8221;</p>

from the land, from the house Nonoual, where were the four Tutulxiu,
from Zuiva at the west; they came from the land Tulapan, having formed a
league.</p>

<p><a name="mani_english_2" id="mani_english_2"></a><a href="#mani_maya_2">2</a>. Four katuns had passed in which they journeyed when they arrived here
with Holon Chantepeuh and his followers. When they set out for this
country it was the eighth ahau. The sixth ahau, the fourth ahau, the
second ahau (passed), four score years and one year, for it was the
first year of the thirteenth ahau when they arrived here in this
country; four score years and one year in all had passed since they
departed from the land and came here, to the province Chacnouitan. These
were <span class="chapword">years</span> <span class="years">81.</span></p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_notes_3">Notes</a></span><a name="mani_english_3" id="mani_english_3"></a><a href="#mani_maya_3">3</a>. The eighth ahau, the sixth ahau; in the second ahau Ahmekat Tutulxiu

the fourth ahau, the second ahau, the thirteenth ahau, three score years
they ruled Ziyan caan when they descended here: in these years that they
ruled Bakhalal it occurred then that Chichen Itza was discovered. 60
years.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_notes_5">Notes</a></span><a name="mani_english_5" id="mani_english_5"></a><a href="#mani_maya_5">5</a>. The eleventh ahau, the ninth ahau, the seventh ahau, the fifth ahau,
the third ahau, the first ahau, six score years, they ruled at Chichen
Itza; then they abandoned Chichen Itza and went to live at Chanputun;
there those of Itza, holy men, had their houses; these were <span class="chapword">years</span> <span class="years">120.</span></p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_notes_6">Notes</a></span><a name="mani_english_6" id="mani_english_6"></a><a href="#mani_maya_6">6</a>. In the sixth ahau the land of Chanputun was seized. The fourth ahau,

thirteen score years Chanputun was ruled by the Itza men when they came
in search of their houses a second time; in this katun those of Itza
were under the trees, under the boughs, under the branches, to their
sorrow; the years that passed <span class="chapword">were</span> <span class="years">260.</span></p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_notes_9">Notes</a></span><a name="mani_english_9" id="mani_english_9"></a><a href="#mani_maya_9">9</a>. Then were the katuns eleventh ahau, ninth ahau, sixth ahau; in the
eighth ahau the governor of Chichen Itza was driven out on account of
his plotting against Hunac Eel; and this happened to Chac Xib Chac of
Chichen Itza on account of his plotting against Hunac Eel the governor
of Mayapan, the fortress. Four score years and ten years, and it was the
tenth year of the eighth ahau that it was depopulated by Ah Zinteyut

divisions of warriors when they were dispersed by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>Hunac Eel, in order

<p class="parthead">NOTES.</p>

<hr class="chapopen" />

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_1">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_1">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_1" id="mani_notes_1"></a>1. The introductory paragraph is not less obscure in construction than
it is important in its historical statements, and I shall give it,
therefore, a particularly careful analysis.</p>

<p>I have already explained the term <i>u tzolan katun</i>; <i>lukci</i> is the
aorist of <i>lukul</i>, which forms regularly <i>luki</i>, but the mutation to
<i>ci</i> is used when the meaning <i>since</i> or <i>after that</i> is to be conveyed;
as Beltran says, &#8220;cuando el verbo trae estos romances, <i>despues que &ograve;
desde que</i>, como este romance; despues que murio mi padre, estoy triste:
<i>cimci in yume, okomuol</i>&#8221; (<i>Arte del Idioma Maya</i>, p. 61). <i>cab</i> means
country or place, in the sense of residence, whereas <i>luum</i>, used in the
same paragraph, is land or earth, in the general sense. The <i>Dicc. de
Motul</i> says: &#8220;<i>cab</i>, pueblo &ograve; region; <i>in cab</i>, mi pueblo, donde yo soy
natural.&#8221; <i>yotoch</i> is a compound of the possessive pronoun <i>u</i>, his or
their, and <i>otoch</i>, the word for house when it is indicated whose house
it is; otherwise <i>na</i> is used; <i>otoch</i> is probably allied to <i>och</i> a
verbal root signifying to give food to, the house being looked upon as
specifically the place where meals are prepared.</p>

<p>The word <i>cante</i> is translated by Perez and Brasseur as <i>four</i>, and
applied to the Tutulxiu, while the intervening word <i>anilo</i> is not
translated by either: <i>cante</i> is no doubt the numeral <i>four</i> with the
numeral particle <i>te</i> suffixed. But here a serious difficulty arises.
According to all the grammars and dictionaries the particle <i>te</i> is
never used for counting persons, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>but only &#8220;years, months, days (periods
of time), leagues, cacao, eggs and gourds.&#8221; Moreover, what is <i>anilo</i>?
We have, indeed, the form <i>tenilo</i>, I am that one, from the particle <i>i</i>
(Buenaventura, <i>Arte de la Lengua Maya</i>, fol. 27, verso); and we might
have <i>yanilo</i>, they are those. But this necessitates a change in the
text, and if that has to be done I should prefer to suppose that <i>anilo</i>
was a mistake of the copyist, and that we should read <i>katun</i> or
<i>katunile</i>. This would reconcile the numeral particle and would do away
with the <i>four</i> Tutulxius, of whom we hear nothing afterwards.</p>

<p><i>chikin</i>, the West, literally, that which bites or eats the sun, from
<i>chi</i>, the mouth, and, as a verb, to bite. An eclipse is called in Maya
<i>chibal kin</i>, the sun bitten; <i>ti chikin</i>, toward the West.</p>

<p><i>talelob</i>, plural form of <i>tal</i> or <i>talel</i>, to come to, to go from.</p>

<p><i>chiconahthan</i> is not translated by either Pio Perez or Brasseur, nor in
that precise form has it any meaning. I take it, however, to be a faulty
orthography for <i>chichcunahthan</i> which means to support that which
another says, hence, to agree with, to act in concert with; &#8220;<i>chichcunah
u thanil</i>, having renewed the agreement&#8221; (<i>Diccionario de Ticul</i>). It
refers to an agreement entered into by the different leaders who were
about to undertake the migration into unknown lands. Possibly, however,
this is not a Maya word, but another echo of Aztec legend.
<i>Chiconauhtlan</i>, &#8220;the place of the Nine,&#8221; was a village and mountain
north of the lake of Tezcuco and close to the sacred spot Teotiuacan,
where, in Aztec myth, the gods assembled to create the sun and moon
(Sahagun, <i>Historia de Nueva Espa&ntilde;a</i>, Lib VII, cap. II). <i>Tulapan
Chiconauhtlan</i> would thus become a compound local name.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>It will be seen from the above that the translation which I have given
of this paragraph does not satisfy me as certainly correct. I shall now
give the original with an interlinear translation, and also those of Pio
Perez and Brasseur, adding a free rendering which I am inclined to
prefer, although it modifies the text somewhat.</p>

<p class="sectionhead"><i>Translation of Pio Perez.</i></p>

<p>Esta es la serie de Katunes corridos desde que se quitaron de la tierra
y casa de Nonoual en que estaban los cuatro Tutulxiu al poniente de
Zuina; el pais de donde vinieron fu&eacute; Tulapan.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><i>Translation of Brasseur.</i></p>

<p>C&#8217; est ici la s&eacute;rie des epoques &eacute;coul&eacute;es depuis que s&#8217; enfuirent les
quatre Tutul Xiu de la maison de Nonoual etant a l&#8217;ouest de Zuin&agrave;, et
vinrent de la terre de Tulapan.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><i>Free translation suggested.</i></p>

<p>This is the order of the Katuns since the four Katuns during which the
Tutulxiu left their home and country Nonoual to the west of Zuiua, and
went from the land and city of Tula, having agreed together to this
effect.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>I have said nothing of the proper names in this paragraph. They are
remarkable for the fact that three out of the four are unquestionably
Nahuatl or Aztec, and hence they have given occasion for considerable
theorizing in favor of the &#8220;Toltec&#8221; origin of the Maya civilization, and
also of the Nahuatl descent of the princely family of the Tutulxiu.</p>

<p>Their name is the only one in the paragraph with a distinctively Maya
physiognomy. It is a compound of <i>xiu</i>, the generic term for herb or
plant, and <i>tutul</i>, a reduplicated form of <i>tul</i>, an abundance, an
excess, as in the verb <i>tutulancil</i>, to overflow, etc. (<i>Diccionario de
Ticul</i>, MS.). It would appear therefore to be a local name, and to
signify a place where there was an abundance of herbage. The surname is
Xiu only, and as such is still in use in Yucatan.</p>

<p>But it may also be claimed that even this is a Nahuatl name; for also in
that tongue <i>xiuitl</i> means a plant, as well as a turquoise, a comet, a
year, and in composition a greenish or bluish color; while <i>tototl</i> is a
bird or fowl. The Maya <i>xiu</i> and the Nahuatl <i>xiuitl</i> (in which <i>itl</i> is
a termination lost in composition) are undoubtedly the same word. Which
nation borrowed it from the other? It is certainly a loan-word, for
these two languages have no common origin, while, as we might expect
from neighbors, each does have a number of loan-words from the other.</p>

<p>I answer that the Maya <i>xiu</i> is unquestionably a loan from the Nahuatl,
and my reason for the opinion is that while in Maya the root <i>xiu</i> is
sterile and has no relations to other words (unless perhaps to <i>xiitil</i>,
to open like a flower, to brood as a bird, to augment, to grow), in
Nahuatl it is a very fertile root, and nearly thirty compounds of it can
be found in the dictionaries (See Molina, <i>Vocabulario de la Lengua
Mexicana</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>fol. 159, verso). But the composition of the name follows the
Maya and not the Nahuatl analogy.</p>

<p>That in either language the name Tutulxiu can be translated &#8220;Bird-tree&#8221;
(Vogelbaum), as is argued by Dr. Carl Schultz-Sellack (<i>Archiv f&uuml;r
Ethnologie</i>, Band XI, 1879), and on which translation he bases a long
argument, is very doubtful. It certainly could not in Maya; and in
Nahuatl, <i>tototl</i> in composition would drop both its terminal
consonants.</p>

<p>The remaining names, Nonoual, Zuiua, Tula-pan, clearly indicate their
Nahuatl origin. Zuiua, which was erroneously printed in Pio Perez&#8217;s
version as Zuina is Zuiva; Nonoual is Nonohual; Tulapan, literally &#8220;the
standard of Tula,&#8221; refers to the famous city of the Toltecs, presided
over by Quetzalcoatl. All these names are borrowed directly from the
myth of this hero-god.</p>

<p><i>Zuiven</i> was the name of the uppermost heaven, the abode of the Creator
Hometeuctli, the father of Quetzalcoatl, and the place of his first
birth as a divinity. In later days, when the Quetzalcoatl myth had
extended to the Kiches and Cakchiquels, members of the Maya family in
Guatemala, &#8220;Tulan Zuiva&#8221; was identified with the Aztec Chicomoztoc, the
famous &#8220;Seven Caves,&#8221; &#8220;Seven Ravines,&#8221; or &#8220;Seven Cities,&#8221; from which so
many tribes of Mexico, wholly diverse in language and lineage, claimed
that their ancestors emerged in some remote past (compare the <i>Codex
Vaticanus</i>, Lam. I; <i>Codex Zumarraga</i>, chap. I, with the <i>Popol Vuh</i>,
pp. 214, 227). To this spot the ancestors of the Guatemalan tribes were
reported to have gone to receive their gods; from it issued the Aztec
god Huitzilopochtli; in it still were supposed to dwell his mother and
other mighty divinities; and Quetzalcoatl was again the youngest born of
Iztac Mixcohuatl, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>mighty lord of the Seven Caves (Motolinia,
<i>Historia de los Indios de Nueva Espa&ntilde;a</i> <a name="corr12" id="corr12"></a><ins class="correction" title="p.">p</ins> 10, etc.).</p>

<p><i>Tula</i>, properly <i>Tollan</i>, a syncopated form of <i>Tonatlan</i>, which means
&#8220;the place of the Sun,&#8221; was a name applied to a number of towns in
Mexico, all named after that magnificent city inhabited by the Tolteca
(&#8220;dwellers in the place of the Sun&#8221;), servants and messengers of the
Light-God their ruler, the benign, the virgin-born Quetzalcoatl. The
common tradition ran that it was destroyed by the wiles of Tezcatlipoca,
the brother, yet the eternal enemy, of Quetzalcoatl, and that at its
destruction the Toltecs disappeared, no one knew whither, while
Quetzalcoatl, after reigning a score of years in Cholula, journeyed far
eastward to the home of the Sun, where he enjoyed everlasting life.</p>

<p><i>Nonohual</i> also had a place in this myth. It was a mountain over against
Tulan. There it was that the eldest sister of Quetzalcoatl resided. When
he was made drunken by the insidious beverage handed him as a healing
draught by Tezcatlipoca, he sent for this sister, held to her lips the
intoxicating cup, and with her passed a night of debauch, the memory of
which filled him with such shame that nevermore dared he face his
subjects. Such is the story recited at length in the Aztec chronicle
called the <i>Codex Chimalpopoca</i>.</p>

<p><i>Nonoalco</i> was also the name of a small village near the city of Mexico
which still appears on the maps. Sahagun tells us that some extreme
eastern tribes in Mexico called themselves <i>Nonoalca</i> (<i>Historia de la
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a</i>, Lib. X, <a name="corr13" id="corr13"></a><ins class="correction" title="cap.">cap,</ins> XXIX, <a name="corr14" id="corr14"></a><ins class="correction" title="p.">p</ins> 12); and the licenciate
Diego Garcia de Palacio mentions &#8220;quatro lugares de Indios que llaman
los Nunualcos&#8221; as dwelling, in his time (1576), in the eastern part of
the province of San Salvador, of Aztec descent, and who had recently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>come there. (<i>Carta al Rey de Espa&ntilde;a</i>, p. 60, New York, 1860). It should
be mentioned in reference to these names and all others of similar
vocalization, that both in Maya and Nahuatl the Spanish constantly
confound the short &#335; and &#365;. As the Bachelor Don Antonio Vasquez
Gastelu observes: &#8220;usan de la <i>o</i> algunos tan obscuramente, que tira
algo &agrave; la pronunciacion de la <i>u</i> vocal&#8221; (<i>Arte de lengua Mexicana</i>,
fol. 1, verso, La Puebla de los Angeles, 1726).</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Alfredo Chavero, in his Appendix to Duran&#8217;s <i>Historia de las
Indias de Nueva Espa&ntilde;a</i> (p. 45, Mexico, 1880), claims that <i>Nonoalca</i>
was the name given to the Maya-Kiche tribes, or rather adopted by them,
when, at an extremely remote epoch, they penetrated to the central table
land of Mexico. He thinks that subsequently they became united with the
Toltecs, and were dispersed with that people at the destruction of the
city of Tula. The grounds for this theory he claims to find in certain
unpublished manuscripts, which unfortunately he does not give in
extracts, but only in general statements. Like much that this writer
presents, these assertions lack support. All the names he quotes as of
Nonoalca, that is, Maya origin, are distinctly not of the latter tongue,
but are Nahuatl. And the introduction of the mystical city of Tula is of
itself enough to invest the story with the garb of unreality.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, nowhere in terrestrial geography that we need look for
the site of the Tula of Quetzalcoatl, nor at any time in human history
did the Tolteca ply their skillful hands, nor Tezcatlipoca spread his
snares to destroy them. All this is but a mythical conception of the
daily struggle of light and darkness, and those writers who seek in the
Toltecs the ancestors or instructors of any nation whatsoever, make the
once common <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>error of mistaking myth for history, fancy for fact.
Therefore, any notion that Yucatan was civilized by the Toltecs after
their dispersion, or owes anything to them, as so many, and I might say
almost all recent writers have maintained, is to me an absurdity.</p>

<p>This reference to the Quetzalcoatl myth at the commencement of the Maya
chronicle needs not surprise us. We encounter it also in the Kiche
<i>Popol Vuh</i> and the Cakchiquel <i>Memorial de Tecpan Atitlan</i>. These
members of the Maya family also grafted that myth upon their own
traditions. As history, it is valueless; but as indicative of a long and
early intercourse between the Maya and Nahuatl speaking tribes, it is of
great interest. As this question will also recur in reference to various
later passages in the Maya chronicles, I will discuss it here.</p>

<p>One of the earliest historians of Yucatan, the Doctor Don Pedro Sanchez
de Aguilar, states that six hundred years before the Spanish conquest
the Mayas were vassals of the Aztecs, and that they were taught or
forced by these to construct the extraordinary edifices in their
country, such as are found at Uxmal and Chichen Itza. His words are:
&#8220;Fueron tan politicos y justiciosos en Yucatan como los Mexicanos, cuyos
vasallos habian sido seis cientos a&ntilde;os antes de la llegada de los
Espa&ntilde;oles. De lo cual tan solamente hay tradicion y memoria entre ellos
por los famosos, grandes y espantosos edificios de cal y canto y
silleria y figuras y estatuas de piedra labrada que dejaron en Oxumual
[Uxmal] y en Chicheniza que hoy se veen y se pudieran habitar.&#8221; <i>Informe
contra Idolum Cultores del Obispado de Yucatan</i>, fol. 87 (Madrid, 1639).</p>

<p>The vague tradition here referred to was made part of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>testimony in a
lawsuit at Valladolid, Yucatan, in 1618. These old documents were
brought to light by the late eminent Yucatecan historian Doctor Justo
Sierra, and Dr. Berendt took a copy in manuscript of the most important
points. I think it worth while to insert and translate this testimony.</p>

<p class="titlepage">(<i>Translation.</i>)</p>

<p class="titlepage"><span class="smcap">Corporation of Valladolid&mdash;Year 1618.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Document No. 1.</span> To the first question the witness answered that he
knows the said Don Juan Kahuil and the said Dona Maria Quen his lawful
wife, and all those referred to in the question; that this witness had
full information from his father, who formerly was <i>ahkin</i> or priest
among the natives, before they had received the water of baptism, how
the parties above mentioned in the question came from the kingdom of
Mexico, and established <span class="nowrap">towns<a name="FNanchor_116-1_68" id="FNanchor_116-1_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_116-1_68" class="fnanchor">116-1</a></span> in these provinces, and that they
were a warlike and valiant people and lords, and thus some of them
established themselves at Chichen Itza, and others went to the south and
established towns at Bacalar, and toward the north and established towns
on the coast; because they were three or four lords, and one, who was
named <i>Tumispolchicbul</i>, was a kinsman of Montezuma, king of the kingdom
of Mexico, and that <i>Cuhuikakcamalcacalpuc</i> was a very near kinsman of
the said Don Juan Kahuil on his father&#8217;s side, and that the said
<i>Ixnahaucupul</i>, daughter of <i>Kukumcupul</i> was wife of the grandfather of
the said Don Juan <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>Kahuil, all of whom were those who came from Mexico to
found towns in these provinces, prominent people and lords; then they
founded towns and ruled this land, because as he said, he heard his said
father say that they were regarded, obeyed and respected as lords of
this land, and that from one of them proceeded the said Don Juan Kahuil;
and of these there is abundant information, and his said father often
said to him that there was unanimity among them as to what took place by
these lords.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smrom">2ND.</span> To the second question this witness answered that as he has said,
he heard his father and other leading Indians say that the parties above
mentioned in the first question came from the Kingdom of Mexico to found
towns in these provinces; some remained in Chichen Itza, who were those
who built the sumptuous edifices which are in the said locality; others
went to found towns at Bacalar, and others to found towns on the coast
to the north; and he who went to found towns on the coast was named
Cacalpuc, from whom proceeds the said Don Juan Kahuil and those who thus
made division went to found towns in the above mentioned provinces, and
held them under subjection and government; and he chose a certain Cocom
to rule in Chichen Itza, and they all obeyed him as lord, and those of
the island of Cozumel were subject to him; and from there (from Chichen
Itza) they passed to the province of Zotuta, where they were when the
conquerors came, and they were always regarded, obeyed and respected as
lords.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smrom">3RD.</span> To the first question this witness answered that he knew all the
parties mentioned in the question and had abundant information about
them, because Don Juan Carnal who was chief and governor of Sisal, one
of the first <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>who governed it by commission and brief given him by the
Auditor Tomas Lopez, being one of the ancient chiefs of the said town in
these provinces, spoke of the subject in conversation with his leading
men and with this witness, who was constantly in his house and was chief
clerk in ordinary in it, saying the parties mentioned had come from
Mexico to found towns in this land of Yucatan, and that some settled at
Chichen Itza, and erected the very stately edifices which are in the
said locality, and that those who came from Mexico were four kinsmen or
relatives with their friends and the people they brought with them; one
settled as heretofore said at Chichen Itza, one went to settle at
Bacalar, one went toward the north and settled on the coast, and the
other went toward Cozumel; and they founded towns with their people, and
were lords of these provinces, and governed them and ruled them many
years; and that he had heard it said that one of them named
<i>Tanupolchicbul</i> was a kinsman of Moctezuma, King of Mexico.&#8221;</p>

<p>This legend is also related, with some variation, by Herrera, and as I
shall have occasion more than once to refer to his account, I shall
translate it.</p>

<p>&#8220;At Chichen Itza, ten leagues from Itzamal, the ancients say there
reigned three lords, brothers, who came from the west, and gathered
together many people, and reigned some years in peace and justice; and
they constructed large and very beautiful edifices. It is said that they
lived unmarried and very chastely; and it is added that in time one of
them was missing, and that his absence worked such bad results that the
other two began to be unchaste and partial; and thus the people came to
hate them, and slew them, and scattered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>abroad, and deserted the
edifices, especially the most stately one, which is ten leagues from the
sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those who established themselves at Chichen Itza call themselves Itzas;
among these there is a tradition that there ruled a great lord called
Cuculc&agrave;n, and all agree that he came from the west; and the only
difference among them is as to whether he came before or after or with
the Itzas; but the name of the building at Chichen Itza, and what
happened after the death of the lords above mentioned, show that
Cuculcan ruled the country jointly with them. He was a man of good
disposition, was said not to have had either wife or children, and not
to have known woman; he was devoted to the interests of the people, and
for this reason was regarded as a god. In order to pacify the land he
agreed to found another city, where all business could be transacted. He
selected for this purpose a site eight leagues further inland from where
now stands the city of Merida, and fifteen leagues from the sea. There
they erected a circular wall of dry stone, about a half quarter of a
league in diameter, leaving in it only two gateways. They erected
temples, giving to the largest the name Cuculc&agrave;n, and also constructed
around the wall the houses of the lords among whom Cuculc&agrave;n had divided
the land, giving and assigning towns to each. To the city he gave the
name Mayapan, which means &#8220;the Standard of the Maya,&#8221; as Maya is the
name of their language.</p>

<p>&#8220;By this means the country was quieted and they lived in peace for some
years under Cuculcan, who governed with justice, until, having arranged
for his departure, and recommending them to continue the wise rule he
had established, he left them and returned to Mexico by the same route
he had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>come, remaining in Champoton some time, where, in memory of his
journey, he erected a building in the sea, which remains to this
<span class="nowrap">day.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_120-1_69" id="FNanchor_120-1_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_120-1_69" class="fnanchor">120-1</a></span></p>

<p>Bishop Landa and some other early writers also give versions of this
tradition, but do not add any facts to those in the above quotations.
Evidently it was a widespread legend of the origin of the great
buildings of Chichen Itza. Is it a tradition of fact or is it a myth?</p>

<p>I confess that to me it has a suspiciously mythical aspect. It is too
similar to what I may call the standard hero-myth of the American
Aborigines. Everywhere, both in North and South America, we find the
myth of the four brothers who divided the land between them, one of whom
is superior to the others and becomes the ruler and instructor of the
ancestors of the nation. He does not die, but disappears, or goes to
heaven, and is often expected to return. Just so in one of the Maya
myths, Cuculcan did not return to Mexico, but rose to heaven, whence
once every year he descended to his temple at Mayapan and received the
gifts which from far and wide pious pilgrims had brought to his shrine
(Landa, <i>Relacion</i>, p. 302). All these myths relate to the worship of
the four cardinal points and to the Light-God, as I have shown in a
previous work (<i>The Myths of the New World</i>, chap. III. New York, 1876).</p>

<p>The proper names in the legend have nothing of a Nahuatl appearance.
They are all pure Maya. The &#8220;kinsman of Moctezuma,&#8221; the second reading
of whose name is the correct one, is given as <i>tan u pol chicbul</i>, &#8220;in
front of the head of the jay-bird,&#8221; the <i>chicbul</i> being what the
Spaniards call the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><i>mingo rey</i>, which I believe is a jay (Beltran, <i>Arte
del Idioma Maya</i>, p. 229). The other long name is a compound of <i>Zuhuy
kak camal cacal puc</i>. The historian Cogolludo informs us that <i>Zuhuy
Kak</i>, literally &#8220;virgin fire,&#8221; was the daughter of a king, afterwards
deified as goddess of female infants (<i>Historia de Yucatan</i>, Lib. IV,
cap. VIII). <i>Camal</i> was and is a common patronymic in Yucatan;
<i>cacalpuc</i> means &#8220;mountain <span class="nowrap">land,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_121-1_70" id="FNanchor_121-1_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_121-1_70" class="fnanchor">121-1</a></span> and thus the whole name is
easily identified as Maya. Possibly the member of the family Camal who
bore the name was a priest of the goddess.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that neither the legend nor the legal testimony
speaks of these foreigners as of a different language or lineage, but
leaves us to infer the contrary. Had they been of Aztec race it would
certainly have been noticed, for the Mayas had frequent mercantile
relations with these powerful neighbors, they borrowed many words from
the Nahuatl tongue, and single chiefs in Yucatan formed alliances with
the Aztec rulers, and introduced Aztec warriors even into Mayapan, as is
shown by the Chronicles I publish in this work, and also by the fact
that a small colony of Aztecs, descendants of these mercenaries, was
living in the province of Canul, west of Merida, when the Spaniards
conquered the country (Landa, <i>Relacion</i>, p. 54). Therefore the Aztecs
were no strangers to the Mayas, and doubtless the learned members of the
priesthood and nobles in the fifteenth century were quite well aware of
the existence of the powerful empire of Anahuac.</p>

<p>But regarding the legend I have quoted as, in part at least, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>based on
actual history, we may accept the fact that there was an important
emigration from Mexico, and yet not one of either Aztecs or &#8220;Toltecs.&#8221;
It must be remembered that the Huastecas, an important branch of the
Maya family, occupied from time immemorial the coast of the Mexican Gulf
north of Vera Cruz, and west to the mountains of Meztitlan, a province
inhabited by a Nahuatl speaking race, but not subject to the dynasty of
the Montezumas.</p>

<p>I have already referred briefly to their history, and it is possible
that after their serious reverses, about 1450, they sent migratory
bodies to their relatives in Yucatan. At any rate, there seems a
consensus of testimony that the general trend of migration of the Maya
race, was from north to south, and in Central America, from west to
east.</p>

<p>We have in this paragraph examples of the use of three of the &#8220;numeral
particles.&#8221; <i>Cante bin ti katun</i>, literally, &#8220;it (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> time) went on
for four katuns,&#8221; and a few lines later <i>hunpel haab</i>, one year,
<i>hunpiztun</i>, the first year.</p>

<p>The correct translation of <i>peten</i> has been debated; it is from the root
<i>pet</i>, anything round, a circle, and usually means &#8220;island.&#8221; By a later
use it signifies any locality with definite boundaries, hence a
province, or kingdom. The following is the entry in the <i>Diccionario de
Motul</i>:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Peten</span>; isla, <i>item</i> provincia, region, comarca&mdash;<i>uay tu petenil
Yucatan</i>, aqui en la provincia de Yucatan.&#8221;</p>

<p>The name of the first leader, Holon Chan Tepeuh, does not recur in the
Annals. Its signification is: <i>holon</i>, a generic name for large bees and
flies; <i>chan</i>, sufficient, powerful, still in use in Yucatan as a
surname; <i>tepeuh</i>, ruler, from <i>tepeual</i>, to rule. This last word is
marked in the <i>Diccionario de Motul</i> as a &#8220;vocablo antiquo.&#8221; It is of
Aztec origin, as in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>Nahuatl language <i>tepeuani</i> means &#8220;conqueror.&#8221;
The name we are considering should probably be rendered &#8220;Holon Chan, the
ruler.&#8221; The province ruled by the Chan family at the time of the
conquest was on the eastern coast, south of that of the Cupuls.</p>

<p>The name <i>Chacnouitan</i> is elsewhere, as we shall see, spelled
<i>Chacnovitan</i> and <i>Chacnabiton</i>. I am inclined to believe the last
mentioned is nearest the correct form. By Pio Perez it was supposed to
be an ancient name of Yucatan, and he translates the phrase, <i>uay ti
petene Chacnouitan</i>, by &#8220;&agrave; esta isla de Chacnavitan (Yucatan).&#8221; Dr.
Valentini says: &#8220;the translation could as well stand for &#8216;that distant
island,&#8217;&#8221; and that &#8220;Chacnouitan was neither the whole nor the northern
part of Yucatan, but a district situated in the southwest of the
peninsula,&#8221; (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 38).</p>

<p>With this I cannot agree, as the adverb <i>uay</i> always refers to the place
(in no matter how wide an accepation) where the speaker is. Therefore I
translate it &#8220;here, (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to this general country of Yucatan, and at
first) to the province Chacnouitan.&#8221; The province referred to was, I
doubt not, somewhere around Lake Peten. The word <i>chac</i> is often used in
local names in Yucatan, and usually means either &#8220;water&#8221; or &#8220;red,&#8221; as it
is a homonym with several significations.</p>

<p>Several names similar to it are found in the Peten district. On Lake
Yaxta, are the ruins of the very ancient city Napeten, and that lake may
have once been called &#8220;Chac-napeten,&#8221; &#8220;the water of Napeten.&#8221; Again, on
the road from Peten to Bacalar is the town Chacnabil, and the compound
<i>Chacnabiltan</i> would mean &#8220;toward or in the direction of Chacnabil&#8221; (see
<i>Itinerarios y Leguarios que proceden de Merida, etc.</i>, p. 15, Merida,
1851). The Itzas always remembered the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>Peten district, and when they met
with reverses in northern Yucatan, they returned to it and established
an important State there, which was not destroyed until the last decade
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_3">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_3">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_3" id="mani_notes_3"></a>3. <i>Hunpel haab minan ti hokal haab</i>, &#8220;one year lacking from five score
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>The name Ahmekat is probably an old form for <i>ahmeknah</i> or <i>ahmektan</i>,
both of which are given in the <i>Diccionario de Motul</i> for chieftain,
leader, captain.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_4">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_4">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_4" id="mani_notes_4"></a>4. <i>Lai tun</i>, the relative <i>lai</i> with the particle <i>tun</i>, which is
called by Beltran a &#8220;particula adornativa.&#8221; <i>uchci</i> is the aorist of the
defective verb <i>uchul</i>, <i>uchi</i>, <i>uchuc</i>, to happen, to take place, come
to pass. <i>Emob</i> is the third plural of <i>emel</i>, to descend, to disembark,
arrive. Pio Perez translates the phrase <i>ca emob uay lae</i>, &#8220;luego
bajaron aqui.&#8221; As this was written in the province of Mani, the &#8220;here&#8221;
now refers in a narrower sense to the vicinity of the writer. The word
<i>chuulte</i> I take to be an error of transcription for <i>uchci</i>, as it is
so translated by Pio Perez. It is noteworthy that the word <i>chicpahci</i>,
&#8220;discovered,&#8221; conveys the sense that Chichen Itza was already in
existence when the migration here recorded reached <a name="corr15" id="corr15"></a><ins class="correction" title="northern">northen</ins>
Yucatan. It is from <i>chicul</i>, a sign or mark by which something is
recognized.</p>

<p>Of the proper names in this section Bakhalal, &#8220;the canebrakes&#8221; (<i>halal</i>,
the cane, <i>bak</i>, a roll or enclosure), is the modern province of
Bacalar, on the east coast of the peninsula. <i>Ziyan caan</i> appears to be
used as a synonym of it, or else refers to a part of it. Its meaning is
a picturesque reference to the view from the sea shore, where the
horizon is clearly defined, and the sky seems to rise from the water,
&#8220;the birth of the sky;&#8221; <i>Ziyan</i>, birth, <i>caan</i>, sky.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>The name Chi C&#295;een Itza was that of one of the grandest ancient
cities of Yucatan. <i>C&#295;een</i> is the name applied to a tract of
low-lying fertile land, especially suitable to the production of cacao
(Berendt); <i>chi</i> is edge or border. It is therefore a name referring to
a locality, &#8220;on the border of the <i>c&#295;een</i> of the Itzas.&#8221; <i>C&#295;een</i>
also means well or cistern, and another derivation is &#8220;at the mouth of
the well,&#8221; as <i>chi</i> can also be rendered &#8220;mouth;&#8221; either of these is
appropriate to the features of the locality, as it is a fertile
low-lying tract with two large natural reservoirs near by.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_5">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_5">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_5" id="mani_notes_5"></a>5. <i>Paxi</i>, from <i>paaxal</i>, a neuter form of the active verb <i>pa</i>, to
break in pieces; it means &#8220;to go to pieces, to fall in ruins, to be
depopulated or deserted.&#8221; Applied to a city it is often translated &#8220;to
be destroyed,&#8221; but it does not convey quite so positive a meaning.
<i>Kuyan uincob</i>, &#8220;men of God,&#8221; from <i>Ku</i> the general name for Divinity.
Chichen Itza was one of the chief centres of religious life in Yucatan,
and its priests were esteemed among the most learned in the peninsula.</p>

<p>The name Chanputun, Champoton, or, reversed, Potonchan, is derived by
Gomara from the Nahuatl <i>potonia</i>, to smell badly, and <i>chan</i>, house (in
composition). Elsewhere, however, we find it in the form Chakanputun,
and this is Maya. <i>Chakan</i> is the term applied to a grassy plain, a
savanna, and it was especially applied to the ancient province in which
the city of Ho, now Merida, was situated, as appears from the following
entry in the <i>Diccionario de Motul, MS.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ahchakan</span>: el que es de M&eacute;rida, o de los pueblos de aquella comarca, que
se llama <i>Chakan</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The correct form of the name is probably <i>Chakan peten</i>, the savanna
region.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_6">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_6">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_6" id="mani_notes_6"></a>6. The only obscure expression in this section is <i>yalan che, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>yalan
aban, yalan ak</i>. This often recurs in the ancient Maya manuscripts, and
was evidently a well-known formula, probably the refrain of one of their
ancient chants. In Mr. Stephens&#8217; translation it is rendered &#8220;under the
uninhabited mountains&#8221;&nbsp;(!) which is an attempt to render Pio Perez&#8217;s
words &#8220;bajo los montes despoblados,&#8221; &#8220;in the uninhabited forests.&#8221;
<i>Aban</i> or <i>haban</i> is an obsolete word, only found in compounds, as
<i>yoxhaban</i>, huts made of branches. Both it and <i>ak</i> were the names of
various branches or twigs. The phrase is literally &#8220;under the trees,
under the branches, under the foliage,&#8221; and meant that those who thus
lived were homeless and houseless. It is a striking testimony to the
love of solid buildings and walled cities which characterized the Mayas.</p>

<p>I will add a verse from a curious prophetic chant in one of the Books of
Chilan Balam, where this expression occurs, and which is an interesting
example of these strange songs.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_8">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_8">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_8" id="mani_notes_8"></a>8. The founding of Uxmal by Ahcuitok Tutulxiu is recorded in this
paragraph; <i>ahcui</i> is the name of a species of owl, <i>tok</i> is the flint
stone. By some old writers Uxmal is spelled Oxmal, which would give the
meaning &#8220;to pass thrice,&#8221; <i>ox</i>, three, <i>mal</i>, to pass. From <i>mal</i>,
preterite <i>mani</i>, also was derived the name of the chief city of the
Tutulxiu, with a peculiar signification explained in a note on a
previous page.</p>

<p>Mr. Stephens has taken considerable pains to prove that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>Uxmal with its
astonishing edifices was inhabited at and after the conquest (<i>Incidents
of Travel in Yucatan</i>, Vol. II, p. 259); there may, indeed, have been an
Indian village there, but the first European traveler who has left us a
description of it, and who visited it in 1586, when many natives, born
before the conquest, were still living, describes the massive buildings
as even then in ruins, and very large trees growing upon them. An old
Indian told him that according to their traditions, these structures had
at that time been built nine hundred years, and that their builders had
left the country nearly that long ago. (<i>Relacion Breve y Verdadera de
algunas cosas de las muchas </i><a name="corr16" id="corr16"></a><ins class="correction" title="que"><i>qui</i></ins><i> sucedieron al Padre Fray Alonzo
Ponce</i>, in the <i>Coleccion de Documentos para la Historia de Espa&ntilde;a</i>,
vol. LVIII, p. 461.)</p>

<p>The phrase <i>u he&#596;icab Ahcuitok Tutulxiu Uxmal</i> is translated by Pio
Perez &#8220;se pobl&oacute; en Uxmal,&#8221; <a name="corr17" id="corr17"></a><ins class="correction" title="&#8220;established">established</ins> himself in Uxmal,&#8221;
conveying the impression that he merely moved to that city. This is,
however, not the sense of the original. <i>He&#596;icab</i> is an active verb
governing Uxmal as its direct object, and means to found firmly or
promptly.</p>

<p>The expression <i>halach uinicil</i>, the real man, the true man, is a common
idiom for governor or ruler, he being the only &#8220;real man&#8221; in an
autocratic community (ante p. <a href="#Page_26">26</a>).</p>

<p>The name of Mayapan is given in the form Mayalpan, which I think is
dialectic. It is spoken of as an established city under the joint rule
of several chiefs at the date of the founding of Uxmal.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_9">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_9">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_9" id="mani_notes_9"></a>9. This paragraph describes how the ruler of the Itzas lost his share in
the government of Mayapan. <i>Kebanthan</i>, literally a plot, or to plot to
do some injury&mdash;&#8220;concertar de hacer algun mal, y el tal concierto,&#8221;
<i>Diccionario de Motul</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>MS. I have followed Pio Perez in translating
&#8220;against Hunac Eel,&#8221; although &#8220;by Hunac Eel&#8221; seems more correct.
Elsewhere the name is Hunac Ceel. Ancona argues that he was a member of
the Cocom family (<i>Hist. de Yucatan</i>, I. p. 157.)</p>

<p>Several of the names of the seven &#8220;men of Mayapan&#8221; have a Nahuatl
appearance. Kakaltecat=Cacaltecatl, He of the Crow; Ytzcuat=Itzcoatl,
Smirch-faced snake; Xuchueuet=Xochitl, the rose or flower;
Pantemit=Pantenamitl, the Conqueror of the city wall. These would seem
to bear out what Landa and Herrera say, to the effect that at one period
the rulers of Mayapan invited Aztec warriors from the province of
Tabasco to come and dwell in the city and aid them in controlling the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Both Dr. Valentini and Se&ntilde;or Pio Perez are of opinion the Katuns at the
commencement of this paragraph should read the 10th, 8th and 6th,
instead of the 11th, 9th and 6th, as it is necessary in order to
establish consistency with what follows.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_10">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_10">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_10" id="mani_notes_10"></a>10. This is one of the most obscure sections in the chronicle. The
phrase <i>tumenel u uahal uahob</i> is rendered by Pio Perez &#8220;because he made
war,&#8221; while Brasseur translates it &#8220;because of his great feasts.&#8221; The
meaning of the root <i>uah</i> is maize cakes, or, more generally, bread. The
<i>Diccionario de Motul</i> gives: &#8220;<span class="smcap">UAHIL</span>; banquete, convite &ocirc; comida,&#8221; which
is in favor of Brasseur&#8217;s translation.</p>

<p><i>Oxlahun uu&#596;</i>, &#8220;thirteen divisions;&#8221; <i>uu&#596;</i> or <i>uuu&#596;</i> means
literally a fold or double, and hence appears to have been applied to
ranks of men in double rows. I do not find, however, any such meaning
given in the dictionaries. As a numeral particle it is used to count
whatever occurs in folds or doubles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>The number thirteen had a sacredness attached to it, from its frequent
use in the calendar. It appears from a passage in the <i>Popol Vuh</i> that
the Cakchiquels, Pokomams and Pokomchis also divided their tribes into
thirteen sections (<i>Popol Vuh</i>, p. 206). In the Maya language, 13 is
also used to signify a great but indefinite number: thus <i>oxlahun
cacab</i>, thirteen generations, is equivalent to &#8220;forever&#8221;; <i>oxlahun
pixan</i>, thirteen times happy, is to be happy in the supreme degree; more
remote from customary analogies is the phrase for &#8220;full moon,&#8221; <i>oxlhaun
caan u</i>, literally &#8220;the thirteen-sky moon,&#8221; the moon which fills with
its light the whole sky (<i>Diccionario de Motul</i>, MS.).</p>

<p>The phrase <i>u &#596;abal u natob</i> is not translated at all in the English
rendering in Stephens&#8217; <i>Travels</i>, nor in that of Valentini. Brasseur
paraphrases it &#8220;by him who gives intelligence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The proper names Ulmil and Ulil seem both to be derived from <i>ula</i>,
host, the master of the feast.</p>

<p>Here, again, I shall give the originals of the two previous translators.</p>

<p class="titlepage"><i>Translation of Pio Perez.</i></p>

translates the passage thus &#8220;fu&eacute; invadido por los hombres de Itza y su
rey Ulmil, el territorio fortificado de Mayalpan, porque tenia murallas,
y porque gobernaba en comun el pueblo de aquella ciudad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The expression <i>multepal</i>, from <i>mul</i>, to do an act jointly, or in
common, and <i>tepal</i>, to govern, is interesting as showing that the
government of the country in its golden days of prosperity was not one
of an autocratic monarch, but a league or confederation of the principal
chiefs of the peninsula. This is also borne out by the descriptions of
the ancient government to be found in the pages of Landa and Herrera.</p>

<p>The Itzas seized the territory in and around Mayapan, but they were not
the ones who destroyed the city. This was the work of <i>Ahuitzil&#596;ul</i>,
foreign mountaineers. <i>&#390;ul</i>, is the common term for a foreigner in
Maya, and is now-a-days applied especially to the whites. <i>Uitz</i>,
mountain, is used with reference to the high sierra which runs through
central Yucatan, and so Pio Perez understood <i>ahuitzil</i>, &#8220;los que tenian
sus ciudades en la parte monta&ntilde;osa.&#8221; This is probably correct, though <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>we
do not know to whom this appellation refers. Yet it may be added that
another meaning can be given to the phrase; <i>uitz</i> is the term applied
by the natives in some parts of the peninsula to the artificial mounds
or pyramids on which their temples were situated, which are usually
called <span class="nowrap"><i>muul</i>.<a name="FNanchor_132-1_71" id="FNanchor_132-1_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_132-1_71" class="fnanchor">132-1</a></span> In this sense <i>ahuitzil &#596;ul</i> should be rendered
&#8220;foreigners who had great pyramids.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words <i>tan cah Mayapan</i> (not Mayalpan as before) are rendered by Pio
Perez and Brasseur as the name of a province or district; but as they
simply mean &#8220;in the middle of the city of Mayapan,&#8221; it appears to be
their signification here.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_12">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_12">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_12" id="mani_notes_12"></a>12. &#8220;After the fortress was depopulated&#8221; or destroyed. This no doubt
refers to the fortress of Mayapan, spoken of in the previous section.
Aguilar and his companions were wrecked on the coast of Yucatan, in
1511, and this is probably the earliest date of any actual landing of
Europeans, although in 1506, Pinzon had sighted the eastern shores.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_13">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_13">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_13" id="mani_notes_13"></a>13. <i>Mayacimil</i>, &#8220;the death of the Mayas,&#8221; a term applied to a general
and fatal pestilence. Such are referred to by Landa (<i>Relacion</i>, &sect; X.)
and Cogolludo (<i>Historia de Yucatan</i>, Lib. IV, cap. <a name="corr19" id="corr19"></a><ins class="correction" title="VI).">VI),</ins> The
<i>Diccionario de Motul</i>, MS. has this entry:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mayacimil</span>: una mortandad grande que fu&eacute; en Yucatan. Y tomase por
qualquier mortandad y pestilencia que lleva mucha gente.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Noh kakil</i>, <i>noh</i>, great, <i>kak</i>, fire, is the usual word for the
smallpox.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>The reference to the death of Ahpula, who, as we learn from another
chronicle, was a member of the royal Xiu family, is especially valuable
as assigning a definite date in both the Maya and European calendars. It
is specified with great minuteness, and yet Pio Perez made the serious
error in his computations regarding the Maya calendar of reading &#8220;the
sixth year of the 13th ahau&#8221; instead of &#8220;six years from the close of the
13th ahau,&#8221; as, in fact, he himself elsewhere translated it.</p>

<p>The expression <i>u xocol haab ti lakin cuchie</i>, &#8220;the reckoning of the
year was toward the East,&#8221; refers to the circle or wheel marked with the
four cardinal points by which the years were arranged with reference to
the four &#8220;year-bearers&#8221; Kan, Muluc, Ix and Cauac.</p>

<p>The last words of this section, &#8220;sixty years after the fortress was
destroyed,&#8221; are an obvious error, as in the preceding section this date
is said to be that of the first arrival of the Spaniards.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_14">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_14">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_14" id="mani_notes_14"></a>14. <i>Kul uincob</i>, &#8220;mighty men,&#8221; from <i>kul</i>, strong, powerful, probably
akin to <i>ku</i>, god, but not with the religious signification which
<i>kuyen</i> has (see page <a href="#Page_125">125</a>). <i>Caputzihil</i>, literally &#8220;to be born a second
time.&#8221; Bishop Landa assures us positively that a rite of baptism was
known to the Mayas before the arrival of the whites, and that this name
was applied to it (<i>Relacion</i>, p. 144). As will be seen on a later page,
Maya writers usually employed another term to express Christian baptism.</p>

<p>The year in which Bishop Francisco Toral first came to Yucatan was 1562
(Cogolludo, <i>Hist. de Yucatan</i>, Lib. VI, cap. VI). He died in Mexico in
1571.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>The remainder of this chronicle has never been translated or published.
It refers to facts after the Conquest, but I think it of interest to
give it completely, as its manner of dealing with known dates will throw
light on its general accuracy.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_15">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_15">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_15" id="mani_notes_15"></a>15. Bishop Diego de Landa, second bishop of the diocese of Merida, died
at that city in 1579, aged fifty-four years. The first missionaries that
came to Mani were Fathers Villalpando and Benavente, in 1547 (Cogolludo,
<i>Hist.</i>, Lib. V, cap. VII). The convent there was established in 1549.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_16">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_16">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_16" id="mani_notes_16"></a>16. No town of the name Yokhaa is now known. But I find on the ancient
native map of Mani, dating from 1557, given by Stephens (<i>Travels in
Yucatan</i>, Vol. II, p. 264), a locality marked <i>Yokha</i>, marked with a
cross. This is no doubt the reference in the text.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_17">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_17">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_17" id="mani_notes_17"></a>17. The Auditor Don T&#335;mas Lopez came to Yucatan from Guatemala. He
was in Yucatan as early as 1552, and published laws in that year
(Cogolludo, Lib. V, cap. XIX, Lib. VII, cap. XI). A hospital was founded
very early in Mani, according to Cogolludo, but he does not give the
exact date (<i>ibid.</i>, Lib. IV, cap. XX).</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#mani_maya_18">Maya</a><br /><a href="#mani_english_18">English</a></span><a name="mani_notes_18" id="mani_notes_18"></a>18. Doctor Don Diego Quijada arrived in Yucatan in 1562, and remained

be <i>chulub</i>, and so I have translated it. Berendt suggested <i>ca botab

drought.</p>

<p class="titlepage"><i>From the Book of Chilan Balam of Tizimin.</i></p>

<hr class="chapopen" />

<p>Tizimin is a town of some importance, in the district of Valladolid,
about a hundred miles east of Merida. The &#8220;Book of Chilan Balam&#8221; which
was found there is one of the most ancient known, and appears to have
been written about the close of the sixteenth century. It is now in the
possession of the eminent antiquary, the Canon Crescencio Carrillo y
Ancona, of Merida, who has described it in his work on Maya
<span class="nowrap">literature.<a name="FNanchor_136-1_72" id="FNanchor_136-1_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_136-1_72" class="fnanchor">136-1</a></span> It contains 26 leaves, without numeration, and on the
17th this chronicle is inserted without title or prefatory remarks. It
is evidently a version of that previously given from the Book of Mani,
although a few additional particulars are stated, and there seems to
have been an attempt to arrange the epochs in more completeness.</p>

<p>This has led to the insertion of a number of katuns which I think it
evident do not properly come into the count. To correct the list the
ka<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>tuns 8th, 6th, and 4th, mentioned in &sect;2, should be considered the same
as 8th, 6th, and 4th, repeated in &sect;3 and &sect;4. Again, in section 11, the
8th katun, on which the attack on Mayapan occurs, is to be considered
the same as the 8th with which &sect;12 begins, and the whole of the 25
katuns which are either stated to have intervened, or must be added in
order to make the series correct, are to be omitted. Finally, the 8th
katun at the close of &sect;10 should immediately follow the 10th at the
close of &sect;8.</p>

<p class="parthead">NOTES.</p>

<hr class="chapopen" />

<p>The entire omission of the introductory paragraph of the Mani chronicle,
with its references to the Quetzalcoatl myth, is noteworthy.</p>

<p>As neither chronicle begins with the beginning of an Ahau Katun, it is
obvious that some era was fixed upon in later days from which to count
the Katuns backward in time to the dawn of tradition, as well as
forward.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#tizimin_maya_2">Maya</a><br /><a href="#tizimin_english_2">English</a></span><a name="tizimin_notes_2" id="tizimin_notes_2"></a>2. On the name <i>Chacnabiton</i> see page <a href="#Page_123">123</a>.</p>

both of which mean to learn or learn about. On <i>Zian can</i> see page <a href="#Page_124">124</a>.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#tizimin_maya_4">Maya</a><br /><a href="#tizimin_english_4">English</a></span><a name="tizimin_notes_4" id="tizimin_notes_4"></a>4. I am at a loss for the exact bearing of the expression <i>lai tzolci
Pop</i>. Pop is the first month in the Maya year; <i>tzoolol</i> is &#8220;to be
counted in order&#8221; (<i>Dicc. Motul</i>); the preterite in <i>ci</i> would seem to
justify the rendering &#8220;since then Pop was counted in regular
succession;&#8221; (see remarks on the effect of <i>ci</i>, on page <a href="#Page_106">106</a>); in other
words, that the calendar was adopted at that time, which was also at the
beginning of an Ahau Katun, and, by the count given (supplying the
katuns not mentioned by the writer) thirty katuns, 600 years, since
their traditions began.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#tizimin_maya_6">Maya</a><br /><a href="#tizimin_english_6">English</a></span><a name="tizimin_notes_6" id="tizimin_notes_6"></a>6. <i>Chuccu</i>, passive of <i>chucah</i>, to seize, take possession of.</p>

<p><i>Zatahob be</i>, &#8220;they lost the road,&#8221; probably meant, in a figurative

for <i>binciob</i>. The expression <i>yalan che</i>, <i>yalan haban</i>, <i>yalan ak</i>,

<i>ocol</i>, to enter, <i>na</i>, the houses, <i>kuch</i>, the crow or buzzard, the
number of the dead being so great that the carrion birds entered the

<p>In the account of Ahpula&#8217;s death <i>ca &#596;ococ</i> should, I think, read <i>ca

<p class="titlepage"><i>From the Book of Chilan Balam of Chumayel.</i></p>

<hr class="chapopen" />


<p>The village of Chumayel is about six leagues east of Mani, and within
the boundaries of the province anciently ruled by the Xiu family.</p>

<p>The copy of the Book of Chilan Balam which was found there was a
redaction made by an Indian, Don Juan Josef Hoil, in 1782. Like all
these volumes it is a sort of common place book, in which were copied
miscellaneous articles from much older manuscripts. One of these bears
the date 1689, but most of them have no date attached. Hoil&#8217;s original
is, I believe, in the possession of the Canon Crescencio Carrillo y
Ancona, of Merida. A fac-simile copy, by the hand of the late Dr.
Berendt, is in my possession.</p>

<p>At the close of the volume, ff. 40-44, are found three summaries of the
ancient history of Yucatan, which are those I am about to give. They
have never been translated from the original, nor published in any form,
and they contain details of interest. They are evidently from different
sources, and are also different from those previously given.</p>

<p class="parthead">NOTES.</p>

<hr class="chapopen" />

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chumayel_maya_intro">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chumayel_english_intro">English</a></span><a name="chumayel_notes_intro" id="chumayel_notes_intro"></a>The writer states, in a brief introduction, the nature and purpose of
his composition.</p>

<p><i>U kahlay</i>, the record, or the memoir, from <i>kahal</i>, to remember. The
concrete meaning of the root is &#8220;to know by sight, to recognize.&#8221;
<i>&#596;iban</i>, past participle, passive voice, of <i>&#596;ib</i> to write: the
original signification of the word is &#8220;to paint.&#8221; <i>Yoheltabal</i>, passive
form of <i>ohel</i>, to know, which is always conjugated with the pronominal
prefixes, <i>u</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>y</i>. <i>Yolah</i>, syncopated form of <i>u uolah</i>, he
wills, wishes, <i>uol=volo</i>, <i>uolah=voluntas</i>.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that this chronicle is not called an &#8220;arrangement&#8221; of
the katuns, <i>tzolan katun</i>, but a count or reckoning of them, <i>xocan</i> or
<i>xocol</i>, from <i>xoc</i>, to count.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chumayel_maya_1">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chumayel_english_1">English</a></span><a name="chumayel_notes_1" id="chumayel_notes_1"></a>1. The count begins with the discovery of Chichen Itza, mentions that
Pop was &#8220;counted in order&#8221; at the beginning of the next following Ahau
Katun, and having stated the desertion of Chichen Itza and the migration
to Chakanputun, the chronicler draws a line, as if to separate broadly
these occurrences from those which followed.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chumayel_maya_5">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chumayel_english_5">English</a></span><a name="chumayel_notes_5" id="chumayel_notes_5"></a>5. The distinction between <i>paa</i> and <i>tulum</i> appears to be that <i>tulum</i>
is an enclosure surrounded by a defensive wall, and this wall itself;
while <i>paa</i> is a castle, or, in Maya land, a mound or pyramid with
buildings on it erected for purposes of defence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span><span class="notes"><a href="#chumayel_maya_6">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chumayel_english_6">English</a></span><a name="chumayel_notes_6" id="chumayel_notes_6"></a>6. <i>Kakil nohkakil</i>, the fire, the great fire, but here in the sense of
a contagious febrile disease, probably the smallpox.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chumayel_maya_7">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chumayel_english_7">English</a></span><a name="chumayel_notes_7" id="chumayel_notes_7"></a>7. The text in this section is corrupt, and I leave a line untranslated.
The writer informs us, what was omitted in the previous chronicles, that
the Ahpula whose death is so carefully mentioned by all, was a member of
the Xiu family which reigned over the province of Mani. They were almost
the first of the powerful Maya nobles to make friends with the
Spaniards. The date 158 is apparently intended for 1538, or perhaps
1508, which is more consistent with the following section, but less so
with the previous chronicles.</p>

<p><i>Kul uinicob</i>, as remarked on page <a href="#Page_133">133</a>, means &#8220;the mighty men,&#8221; not the
&#8220;holy men,&#8221; as generally translated. The term was applied to the
Spaniards. The <i>Dicc. de Motul</i> MS. says:&mdash;&#8220;<span class="smcap">KULVINIC</span>: muy hombre, hombre
de respeto y de hecho, y llaman as&iacute; los Indios &aacute; los Espa&ntilde;oles.&#8221; <i>U yah
talzah</i>, they bring the sickness, probably the smallpox. <i>Coon</i> or
<i>con</i>, 1st pers. pl. pres. indic. of the irregular verb <i>cen</i> (<i>cihi</i>,
<i>ciac</i>), to say, to tell.</p>

<h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="IV_THE_MAYA_KATUNS" id="IV_THE_MAYA_KATUNS"></a>IV. THE MAYA KATUNS.</h2>

<p class="titlepage"><i>From the Book of Chilan Balam of Chumayel,</i></p>

<hr class="chapopen" />


<p>The following chronicle is stated by its writer to be distinctively
called the &#8220;Maya Katuns,&#8221; and to be written for (or by) the Itzas. We
have, therefore, no longer to do with the reckoning of the subjects of
the Xiu family who ruled at Mani, but with one which emanates from the
priests of the Cocomes, who were hereditary masters of Chichen Itza. It
is evidently of different origin, although many of the same facts are
referred to in it.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#itza_maya_1">Maya</a><br /><a href="#itza_english_1">English</a></span><a name="itza_notes_1" id="itza_notes_1"></a>1. The writer begins with the 12th ahau, although nothing is noted until
the 6th. Here we have the brief entry <i>paxciob ahoni</i>. This might be
translated &#8220;those of Oni were driven out or scattered.&#8221; But no such
locality is known or mentioned elsewhere. The <i>Diccionario de Motul,
MS.</i> gives the meaning of <i>ahoni</i> as &#8220;pulido, galan, muy bien vestido,&#8221;
<i>ahoni a talel ex</i>, &#8220;you come very well dressed.&#8221; I suppose, therefore,
that it was a term applied to some early tribe who distinguished
themselves in comparison with their ruder neighbors by elegance of
costume. Later we shall find a similar term, &#8220;breechless foreigners,&#8221;
applied to another tribe whose condition of nudity suggested their
appellation.</p>

<p>The name Kinich Kakmo is mentioned by Cogolludo as that of an idol
worshiped at Itzamal. He says:&mdash;&#8220;They had another temple on another
mound in the northern part of the city, and this, from the name of an
idol which they worshiped here, they called <i>Kinich Kakm&oacute;</i>, which means
the sun with a face. They say that the rays were of fire and descended
at mid-day to consume the sacrifice, as the vacamaya flies through the
air (which is a bird something like a parrot, though larger in size, and
with finely colored feathers). They resorted to this idol in time of
mortality, pestilence or much sickness, both men and women, and brought
many offerings. They said that at mid-day a fire descended and consumed
the sacrifice in the sight of all. After this the priests replied to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>their inquiries about the sickness, famine or pestilence, and thus they
learned their fate; although it often turned out quite the contrary of
what he predicted.&#8221; (<i>Historia de Yucatan</i>, Lib. IV, cap. VIII.)</p>

<p>The title given by Cogolludo to the divinity appears to have also been
adopted by the ruling chief, who may also have been the high priest. It
is both imperfectly and incorrectly translated by the historian. Its
components are <i>kin</i>, the sun, day; <i>ich</i>, the eye, the face; <i>kak</i>,
fire; <i>moo</i>, the macaw, <i>Psittacus Macao</i>, deemed sacred throughout
Mexico and Central America, on account of its beautiful plumage. The
full translation of the name is &#8220;the Eye of Day, the Sacred Bird of
Fire,&#8221; a symbolic name of a solar deity.</p>

<p>The Chan family is mentioned by Sanchez Aguilar (<i>Informe contra Idolum
Cultores</i>, etc.), as among the princely houses of Yucatan at the date of
the Conquest.</p>

<p><i>Paxci u cah</i>, &#8220;the town,&#8221; that is, Chichen Itza. The writer composed
his chronicle at that place, so he does not think it necessary to name
it specifically. The distance in a straight line from Chichen Itza to
Itzamal is 40 geographical miles.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#itza_maya_2">Maya</a><br /><a href="#itza_english_2">English</a></span><a name="itza_notes_2" id="itza_notes_2"></a>2. <i>Yala</i>, the remainder, from <i>ala</i>, above, over. A portion of the
Itzas remained in Chichen after the attack by Kinich Kakmo; these also
now leave it.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#itza_maya_3">Maya</a><br /><a href="#itza_english_3">English</a></span><a name="itza_notes_3" id="itza_notes_3"></a>3. The place <i>Xuluc mul</i> is unknown in the present geography of the
peninsula. It means &#8220;the completed mounds,&#8221; <i>mul</i> being, as I have
before remarked, the name given to the artificial pyramids and tumuli of
stone so common in the peninsula, probably so called from the joint
labor of many in their construction.</p>

<p>The province of Zaclactun-Mayapan is also unknown, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>although there is a
hacienda Zaclactun within the boundaries of the modern district of
Itzamal (Berendt, <i>Nombres geograficos en Lengua Maya</i>, MS.). The name
apparently means &#8220;the place where white pottery is made.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#itza_maya_4">Maya</a><br /><a href="#itza_english_4">English</a></span><a name="itza_notes_4" id="itza_notes_4"></a>4. <i>Ti chibil uinic</i> &#8220;for men to be eaten;&#8221; <i>chibil</i>, the passive of
<i>chii</i>, to eat. The <i>Diccionario de Motul</i> gives <i>chibil bak</i>, flesh to
be eaten. <i>Pic</i> was the breech cloth or waist cloth, fastened around the
waist and falling to the knees, which was the common dress of the women.
The Dictionary just quoted translates the word, &#8220;naguas de Indias que se
sirven de saya &oacute; faldellin ordinario, para cubrir desde la cintura
abajo; y son las blancas sin color ni bordado.&#8221; The phrase <i>ixma pic
&#596;ul</i>, foreigners without a breech cloth, intimates that they were
nude.</p>

<p>Who were these naked cannibals, who raided the provinces in order to
obtain their unnatural food? Those daring navigators, those naked
man-eaters, the Caribs, from whose name our word <i>cannibal</i> is derived,
at once suggest themselves. Curiously enough, the Abbe Brasseur has
argued for the probability of their invasions upon other (though I think
insufficient) grounds (see his <i>Informe acerca de las Ruinas de Mayapan
y de Uxmal</i>). This passage of the chronicle renders his theory probable.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#itza_maya_5">Maya</a><br /><a href="#itza_english_5">English</a></span><a name="itza_notes_5" id="itza_notes_5"></a>5. <i>Peten tan cah Mayapan</i> could also be rendered, &#8220;the district Tancah
Mayapan.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#itza_maya_6">Maya</a><br /><a href="#itza_english_6">English</a></span><a name="itza_notes_6" id="itza_notes_6"></a>6. <i>C&#295;abi Otzmal u tunile</i>, &#8220;the stone of Otzmal was taken.&#8221; Otzmal
was a locality under the rule of the Cocomes. (Cogolludo, <i>Historia</i>,
Lib. III, cap. VI.) Other versions read Itzmal and Uxmal. The reference
is to the <i>u he&#596; katun</i>, the setting up of the Katun-stone as a
memorial at the end of each period of twenty years. Incomplete
descrip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>tions of this ceremony are given by Landa, <i>Relacion</i>, &sect; IX, and
Cogolludo, <i>Historia</i>, Lib. IV, cap. IV. I propose a more extended
examination of this question in a future volume of this series, devoted
to documents relating to the calendars and chronology of the Central
American nations.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#itza_maya_8">Maya</a><br /><a href="#itza_english_8">English</a></span><a name="itza_notes_8" id="itza_notes_8"></a>8. The death of Ahpula Napot Xiu is given with minuteness but not in
accordance with previous chronicles. In 1519 Cortes touched at the
Island of Cozumel, and that might have been assumed as the date of the
commencement of Christianity.</p>

<p class="titlepage"><i>From the Book of Chilan Balam of Chumayel.</i></p>

<hr class="chapopen" />


<p>The document which follows is brief, but of peculiar interest. It does
not appear to aim at a connected history of events, but in the form of a
chant to refer certain incidents to the katuns in which they occurred.
It has more of a mythological character, and the repetitions remind one
of the refrain of a song.</p>

<p>It is also found in the Book of Chilan Balam of Chumayel, and is
inserted without explanation or introduction, copied, no doubt, from
some ancient writing.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#katuns_maya_1">Maya</a><br /><a href="#katuns_english_1">English</a></span><a name="katuns_notes_1" id="katuns_notes_1"></a>1. <i>U zihilob</i>, the births, probably meaning the beginning of things.
<i>Pauaha en cuh</i> has no meaning that I can make out; I therefore suppose
it an error for <i>pachah u cah</i>, and translate in accordance with this
emendation. The phrase seems to refer to the first settlement of the
country, or to the first time the scattered inhabitants were gathered
together in towns by their chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#katuns_maya_2">Maya</a><br /><a href="#katuns_english_2">English</a></span><a name="katuns_notes_2" id="katuns_notes_2"></a>2. &#8220;These were their names&#8221;; but no names are given. They seem to have
been omitted by the copyist.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#katuns_maya_3">Maya</a><br /><a href="#katuns_english_3">English</a></span><a name="katuns_notes_3" id="katuns_notes_3"></a>3. <i>Emciob noh hemal &#596;eemal</i>, faulty orthography for <i>noh emel,
&#596;eemel</i>, the latter syncopated from <i>&#596;e&#596;emel</i>. Literally, &#8220;since
they descended; the Great Descent, the Little Descent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tradition here referred to is given at more length by Father Lizana,
in his <i>Historia de Yucatan</i>, and is discussed also by Cogolludo
(<i>Historia de Yucatan</i>, Lib. IV, cap. III). As the work of the former is
wholly inaccessible, I quote from the reprint of a portion of it in
Brasseur&#8217;s edition of Diego de Landa&#8217;s <i>Relacion</i> p. 354. &#8220;In former
times they called the East <i>Cen-ial</i>, the Little Descent, and the West
<i>Nohen-ial</i>, the Great Descent. The reason they give for this is that on
the east of this land a few people descended, and on the west a great
many; and with that syllable they understand little or much, to the east
and the west; and that few people came from one direction and many from
the other.&#8221; Father Liz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>ana goes on to express his opinion that the few
who came from the East were the Carthaginians, and the many from the
West were the Mexicans.</p>

<p>The very corrupt form in which he has given the words has led Se&ntilde;or
Eligio Ancona to suppose they belonged to the archaic and secret
language of the priests (<i>Historia de Yucatan</i>, Tomo I, p. 24), and Dr.
Carl Schultz-Sellack to imagine that they referred to East and West,
right and left, as he adopted the misreading <i>&#596;iic</i>, left, for
<i>&#596;e&#596;</i>, little (<i>Die Amerikanischen G&ouml;tter der Vier Weltgegenden</i>, in
the <i>Archiv f&uuml;r Ethnologie</i>, Band XI, 1879). But they are readily
analyzed when we have their correct orthography, as given above. The
reference to them in this place shows that the author of the chant was
dealing with the most ancient legends of his race.</p>

<p>The Itzas who resided in the Peten district left the region around
Chichen Itza some time in the fifteenth century, probably after the fall
of Mayapan. They were ruled by an hereditary chieftain, called by the
Spaniards &#8220;the great king, Canek.&#8221; Under him the territory was divided
into four districts, each with its own chief, with whom the Canek
consulted about important undertakings.</p>

<p>Evidently in removing to Peten the Itzas were retracing their steps on
the line of their first entrance to the peninsula. They even attempted
to go further west, and guided, probably, by ancient memories, a large
number set out for Tabasco and the banks of the <a name="corr23" id="corr23"></a><ins class="correction" title="Usumacinta,">Usumaciuta,</ins> where
repose the ruins of Palenque, possibly the home of their ancestors. But
they were attacked and driven back by the natives of Tabasco, with the
loss of their leader, a brother-in-law of the great Canek. These and
other particulars about them are repeated <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>by Villagutierre Sotomayor,
<i>Historia de la Conquista de la Provincia de el Itza</i>, folio, Madrid,
1701.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#katuns_maya_4">Maya</a><br /><a href="#katuns_english_4">English</a></span><a name="katuns_notes_4" id="katuns_notes_4"></a>4. The elliptical form of expression here renders the translation
difficult. The verb <i>cutal</i> (old form <i>cultal</i>), pret. <i>culhi</i> or
<i>cuthi</i>, fut. <i>culac</i>, means to sit down, to remain in a place, to be at
home there, to reside, etc. Perhaps the translation both here and in &sect; 2
should be, &#8220;for thirteen katuns they ruled, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#katuns_maya_5">Maya</a><br /><a href="#katuns_english_5">English</a></span><a name="katuns_notes_5" id="katuns_notes_5"></a>5. The word <i>yum</i>, plural <i>yumob</i>, means father and also chief, leader,
ruler, etc. In modern Maya it is the translation of Sir, Mister, Se&ntilde;or.</p>

<p>The proper names of the localities whence the four divisions are said to
have come, have a mythological cast. I cannot find any of them in the
present geography of Yucatan. Kin Colah Peten is mentioned in a &#8220;katun
wheel&#8221; in this same Book of Chilan Balam of Chumayel, as the name of one
of the towns which furnished a katun stone. Zuiva I have already
referred to as appearing in the Quetzalcoatl myth (see page <a href="#Page_110">110</a>).</p>

<p>The mountains of Canhek and the Nine Mountains take us to the Itzas
around Lake Peten, in the extreme south of the peninsula, this last
mentioned division being, in fact, that from the south.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#katuns_maya_6">Maya</a><br /><a href="#katuns_english_6">English</a></span><a name="katuns_notes_6" id="katuns_notes_6"></a>6. <i>U payalob</i>, plural passive of <i>pay</i>, to call, to summon.</p>

<p><i>Tan yol che</i>, <i>ol</i> or <i>yol</i> is the heart or centre of the leaf or
plant; <i>tan xuluc mul</i>, see page <a href="#Page_174">174</a>. <i>Yauat pixanobi</i>, they were happy
in singing, or, they gained favor by singing. The expression is obscure.
The verb <i>auat</i> is applied to the singing of birds, the crowing of
cocks, and generally to the natural sound made by any animal, and, in
composition, to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>the sound of musical instruments, as, <i>auatzah</i>, to play
on the flute, to blow a trumpet.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#katuns_maya_7">Maya</a><br /><a href="#katuns_english_7">English</a></span><a name="katuns_notes_7" id="katuns_notes_7"></a>7. <i>Uacchahi</i> from <i>uacchahal</i>, appears to be a strongly figurative
expression. It is explained in Pio Perez&#8217; Dictionary, &#8220;salirse con
esfuerzo de su cubierta &oacute; encaje, saltarse de ella <i>como tripa por el
ano</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Hauic</i>, from <i>haual</i>, to end, finish, cease to exist. Thus the
chronicler closes his recital, repeating the to him no doubt bitter fact
that the Maya nation and the Maya name had passed away.</p>

<h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="CHRONICLE_OF_CHICXULUB" id="CHRONICLE_OF_CHICXULUB"></a>CHRONICLE OF CHICXULUB.</h2>


<hr class="chapopen" />

<p>Among the ancient documents collected by Pio Perez was a series relating
to the town of Chicxulub, about six leagues north of Merida. They are
entitled <i>Documentos de Tierras de Chicxulub, 1542</i>. They consist of a
history of the town and of the conquest of the country, written by Nakuk
Pech, about 1562; a survey of the town lands by several members of the
Pech family, testified to Feb. 7, 1542; a partial list of the Spanish
conquerors; a portion of an account by another member of the Pech
family, and a further statement by Nakuk Pech.</p>

<p>The longest and the most interesting of these is the history of the
Conquest, or, as the writer calls it, &#8220;the history and the chronicle of
Chacxulubchen&#8221;&mdash;<i>u belil u kahlail C&#295;ac Xulub C&#295;en</i>&mdash;this being
one of the native forms of the name of the town. It is headed &#8220;Conquest
and Map,&#8221; but the map has disappeared. Usually such &#8220;maps&#8221; accompanying
the title papers of towns in Yucatan have as a central figure the
outlines of a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>church with the name of the town; around this is drawn the
figure of the town lands, with the names of the wells, trees, stones and
other landmarks mentioned in the titles.</p>

<p>The writer, Nakuk Pech, baptized Pablo Pech, must have been between
sixty and seventy years of age when he drew up his statement, inasmuch
as he mentions occurrences, as late as 1562, and also speaks of himself
as an adult in 1519. He belonged to a noble family, the Pechs of Cumkal,
who are mentioned by Sanchez Aguilar as hereditary <i>batabs</i>, or
independent chiefs. They appear to have given their names to the
province on the west coast called Kin Pech, or Campech, known to the
English as Campeachy, and to that of Ceh Pech, in which the city of Ho,
afterwards called Merida, was situated. The <a name="corr24" id="corr24"></a><ins class="correction" title="Abb&eacute; Brasseur,">Abbe Brass&eacute;ur,</ins> on very
slight grounds, surmised that they were not originally of Maya stock,
but probably descendants of the <span class="nowrap">Caribs.<a name="FNanchor_190-1_93" id="FNanchor_190-1_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_190-1_93" class="fnanchor">190-1</a></span></p>

<p>He states that he was the son of Ak Kom Pech, in baptism Martin Pech,
and the grandson of Ah Tunal Pech, while the head of the house of Pech
seems to have been Ah Naum Pech, baptized Don Francisco de Montejo Pech.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>Pech always uses as the name of his town <i>Chac Xulub Chen</i>, which means
&#8220;the well of the great horns,&#8221; probably because some huge antlers were
found there, or were set up to mark the spot. The modern name <i>Chic
Xulub</i> was probably applied to it as a parody, or a play on words. It
means to cuckold one, to put horns on <span class="nowrap">him.<a name="FNanchor_191-1_94" id="FNanchor_191-1_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_191-1_94" class="fnanchor">191-1</a></span></p>

<p>A literal translation of the document was made by Don Manuel Encarnacion
Avila, of Merida, about 1860, and this has been of service to me in
completing the present rendering. But Se&ntilde;or Avila, though familiar with
the Maya of to-day, was evidently not at all acquainted with the ancient
terms with reference to the calendar, and the usages of the natives
before the Conquest. He therefore made serious errors wherever such
occurred.</p>

<p>Moreover, as it was his purpose to give an extremely literal
translation, he often sacrificed to this both clearness and correctness,
and in various passages his sentences are unintelligible.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Brasseur (de Bourbourg) commenced to copy the original when in
Merida, but completed only the first two paragraphs. He applied for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>copy of the remainder; but by an error he received instead of this an
unfinished transcript of another paper by the Pech family. These
fragments he inserted, with a translation of his own, in the second
volume of the Reports of the <i>Mission Scientifique au Mexique et &agrave;
l&#8217;Am&eacute;rique Centrale</i>, pp. 110-120 (4 to, Paris, Imprimerie Imp&eacute;riale:
1870). As his lexicographic resources were, by his own statement, quite
deficient (<i>id.</i>, note to p. 116), he is scarcely to be criticised if,
as is the case, much of his translation but faintly presents the meaning
of the original.</p>

<p>It will be seen that I have sacrificed every attempt at elegance in the
English translation to an endeavor to preserve faithfully the style of
the original, even to its needless repetitions and awkward sentences.</p>

Spaniards arrived and settled the city of Merida; it was during the 9th
Ahau that Christianity was introduced; the year in which first came our
lords the Spaniards here to this land was the</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_notes_2">Notes</a></span><a name="chronicle_english_2" id="chronicle_english_2"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_2">2.</a> I, who am Nakuk Pech, of the first hidalgos conquistadores here in
this land in the district Maxtunil, I am placed in the first town in the
district Chac Xulub Chen. As thus it is given me to guard by my lord Ah
Naum Pech, I wish to compose carefully the history and chronicle of the
district of Chac Xulub Chen here, my first command, the town having two
districts, Chichinica and, here, Chac Xulub Chen.</p>

Martin Pech, of the town of Xul Kum Chel; thus we were given the
districts to guard by our lord Ah Naum Pech from the town Mutul, and I
was promoted to guard the district Chac Xulub Chen; when our <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>lords, the
Spaniards, did not pass nor come here to this land Yucatan, I was then
governor here in this town, here in this land, Chac Xulub Chen. When our
lord, the Se&ntilde;or Adelantado came here to this province in the year 1519,
I was head chief; when the Spaniards came here to the land of Maxtunil
we received them with loving attention; we also first gave them tribute
and respect, and then we gave to eat to the Spanish captains; he who was
called Adelantado came here to Maxtunil to the dwelling of Nachi May;
then we went to see that they should be given pleasures; they did not
even enter the towns, not even visited the towns; they were here in this
land for three months, being placed here in the district of Maxtunil;
then they departed and went to begin a seaport, the seaport &#390;ilam, and
remained there three years and a half.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_notes_4">Notes</a></span><a name="chronicle_english_4" id="chronicle_english_4"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_4">4.</a> They were there when my father went to make delivery to them; he
called the Adelantado returned here to this land; the maid servant named
Ixkakuk was presented to them by my father to give them food and wait
upon them; and they were there when they were attacked by the Cupuls;
and they departed, and went to live at Ecab Kantanenkin, as is called
the land where <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>they settled; they were there when they were attacked by
those of Ecab, and they departed and arrived at Cauaca, which they
entered, and passed to the town &#390;ekom, as the town is called; they
passed it and arrived at the town Tixcuumcuuc, so-called; and they
departed from there and arrived at the town called Tinuum; and then they
all set out in search of Chichen Itza, so-called; there they asked the
King of the town to meet them, and the people said to them; &#8220;There is a
King, O Lord,&#8221; they said, &#8220;there is a King, Cocom Aun Pech, King Pech,
Namox Chel, King Chel, of &#390;i&#596;antun; foreign warrior, rest in these
houses,&#8221; they said to them, by the Captain Cupul. They departed from
Chichen Itza and arrived with King Ixcuat Cocom of Ake; &#8220;Lords, you
cannot go, you will lose yourselves,&#8221; was said to them by the King
Ixcuat Cocom, and they turned back again, and went and arrived at Cauaca
for the second time, and they reached the seaport called Catzun, where
they marched by the sea, and went and returned to &#390;elebnae, as it is
called, where they first settled when they first came to this land.</p>

Campeche; he, called the Adelantado, the first Spaniard, passed here to
this <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>land; they were at Campeche when they asked tribute; according to
orders by the chiefs to all the villages there was tribute. They passed
on by the sea (asking) for tribute to be brought to them. Then I went
with my companions Ah Macan Pech and his younger brother Ixkil Ytzam
Pech, the king of the town Cumkal, and my father, who was in the town
Xulcumcheel; these were my companions when I went back for the tribute;
they saw it; also Nachi May accompanied us, because he knew that he (the
Adelantado), did not know the language; because they first stayed at his
house when they came, and for this reason they spoke to him to accompany
them when they went after the tribute, because he was a friend to the
Spaniards when it (the tribute) was delivered to the captains; from them
we received coats and cloaks and shoes and rosaries and hats, and had
much pleasure from the captains; we left when the Spaniards had ended
giving these gifts; already we had our clothes when we arrived, the
coats and cloaks (we) Ixkil Ytzam Pech of Conkal, our companions Ah
Macan Pech of YaxKukul, and my father Ah Kom Pech, who were the greatest
of us.</p>

tribute, when we went to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>Campech to deliver tribute, and we came back
when the Spaniards coming on the road from Campech came to the towns to
dwell at Ichcanzihoo, the city of Merida; and when it was heard that the
Spaniards were coming on the road from Campech we went to give them
gifts, and I went the second time to deliver tribute. And I Nakuk Pech
of this district of Chac Xulub Chen, and Ah Macom Pech of the district
Yan Kukul, and Ixkil Ytzam Pech the head chief of Conkal, and also I
Nakuk Pech, chief here in the town Chac Xulub Chen, entered into giving
gifts to them a second time at &#390;ibikal, and they wished an abundance a
second time, and they were given gifts, pheasants, and honey, and sweet
food at &#390;ibilkal, when they came to settle at Merida; Don Francisco de
Montejo, first Captain General, first came here to this land, to Merida,
with Don Francisco de Bracamonte and Francisco Tamayo and Juan de
Pacheco and Perarberes; these captains came in the year 1541.</p>

by the captains, and the Secretary Roderigo Alvarez wrote out the list
of tributes according to each division of the towns, all my companions
and kinsmen paid tribute, sufficient tribute according to the division
of tribute to the Spaniards which the Adelantado made by the captains,
and the Secretary Roderigo Alvarez, in the first year the Spaniards came
to Merida; and I, Nakuk Pech, was taken and given to Don Julian Doncel
the Encomendero, the first lord of the town Chac Xulub Chen, the first
Encomendero, and my hand was given him by the captain Don Francisco de

received baptism, I was called Don Pablo Pech; and I ceased to be called
Nakuk Pech; we first <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>chiefs were created hidalgos by the captains when
possession was first taken of this province, and we first paid tribute
to the foreigners, and possession was given to us by God and the ruling
king; and our descendants are hidalgos, and all our sons, until the time
shall come when the world shall end; and we chiefs were rulers in this
land when there was no Holy Church in the districts, and before the
Spaniards began to march over the country, or to congregate together in
order to worship; and formerly, when the men were not Christians, I
ruled wholly the men, and when I received Christianity I, Nakuk Pech, I
was a chief; and I received the Holy Oils and the Holy Faith in order
that I might teach it to all my subjects; and I was also the first to
receive the rod of the justicia, because I went to aid the Word of God
and our great Lord the ruling king; then our Lord, the Auditor Don
Thomas Lopez, was the first who divided the tribute of the chiefs
according to the towns they occupied; and when the tribute was
satisfactorily finished by the governorship of the Auditor Don Thomas
Lopez, I gave my rod to my son Don Pedro Pech, in the year 1552.</p>

and ministers back to their rulers, when they came to the town Yaxkukul;
and we, also, when we arrived at this town of Chac Xulub Chen. When we
settled here they appointed me, Nakuk Pech, by my father, Ah Kom Pech,

Indians who had a will to pay tribute to the first Spaniards; therefore
the first Spaniards made an account of what towns were to be given to be
governed. I, Nakuk Pech, I first received the town here, in the district
Chac Xulub Chen, when first they came with orders to take it, with the
chiefs, and captains and priests, whose names are Ah Kul Matu and (Ah)
Kul Che; and the first priests arrived, the priest Cocom, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>the priest
Tacu; and the captains arrived, the captain Nachan Cen and the captain
Xuluc, as their names were, the captains who commanded when they came to
this land Maxtunil, with the priest Chuc and his captains, to take
possession; thus they found the town here, Chac Xulub Chen, when came
the soldiers and ensigns, Ensign Kan, Ensign Xuluc, Ensign Pot, Ensign
May, Ensign Ek, such were the names of the ensigns, the names of those I
commanded as chief when I, Nakuk Pech, came to this town Chac Xulub
Chen; thus my mind was strengthened when these things happened, and when
I came here to settle here in the land and district Chac Xulub Chen.</p>

strengthen the town Chac Xulub Chen; then among old men there was no
sign that the Spaniards would come here to this land, nor was the
village of Chac Xulub Chen strengthened then; it was when they heard the
account, when the Spaniards came to the city of Merida and Christianity
was received by the men of the province of Ceh Pech. I finished by
gathering together all the town of Chac Xulub Chen, I, Don Pablo Pech,
and my father, Don Martin Pech, Conquistador of Xulkum Cheel.</p>

together with them, and went with my father, Ah Macan Pech, of the first
lineage of Yaxkukul, and Ixkil Y&#596;am Pech, of the first lineage of
Cumkal, and I went after them to the war; then began the obligation of
tribute to our rulers for the Spanish governors in the town; when we
went to the war there was <i>pinole</i> and <i>tuce</i> to drink, because they
were disgusted with the Christians; for six months we and my companions
followed the Christians in their misfortunes; my father was then
governed by the regidors, who saw that all that I write in my
information truly happened, everything, in order that it may be known by
my family, my sons, in the hereafter, until the end of the world, for my
title and evidence given me by our Lord God and our great lord, the
reigning king; I have no tribute nor do I pay tribute, nor will my sons
nor my daughters pay tribute, because our Lord God released me from it
in the fear of my heart; before I had seen the face of the Spaniards I
had been given willingness that I should deliver myself and all my town
into the hands of the Spaniards, in order that they might be inhabited
by the captains, the Adelantado and the first conquistadores who came
here to this <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>land, Yucatan; and the year the first foreigners came here
to the land of the Cupuls was the year 1511.</p>

<p><a name="chronicle_english_15" id="chronicle_english_15"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_15">15.</a> In former times no one saw Spanish foreigners, not until Jeronimo de
Aguilar was captured by the natives of Cozumel; then first the whole of
the country became known, because all the country was marched over; but
because the whole of the land was not made use of I spoke of it before
the king, when there went before the king Ah Macan Pech, Don Pedro Pech,
and his followers, and the first of his lineage, and all his chiefs
after him; they went after him to honor the king, that he might see the
faces of his servants; then fifty of the principal men went afterwards
to the lord the ruling king, to obey him at table, far off in Spain, and
those remained to obey before the ruling King; then the ruler said that
all should pay tribute and all their sons, even we the Pechs of the
first lineage in this land, and the first lineage of the Cupuls; then it
was said, there is a great province, and many men and things in the
land, and an account shall be made of it before our great king, and now
they shall come to fix the limits of the land for our beloved king. Thus
the land was discovered by Aguilar, who was eaten by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>Ah Naum Ah Pat at
Cuzamil in the year 1517. In this year the katun ended, and then ended
the placing of the town stone, for at each twentieth stone they came to
place the town stones, formerly, when the Spaniards had not yet come to
Cuzamil, to this land; since the Spaniards came, it has ceased to be
done.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_notes_16">Notes</a></span><a name="chronicle_english_16" id="chronicle_english_16"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_16">16.</a> In the year 1519 first came the Spaniards here to Cuzamil, for the
third time, Fernando de Cortes and Espoblaco Lara. On the 28th of
February, there came to Cuzamil for the first time those who knew to
speak the true words. In this year the eaters of anonas first arrived at
Chichen, and then for the first time Chichen Itza became known to the
great Spaniards, (and) to Don Francisco de Montejo, Adelantado, the
governor, when they were posted at Chichen Ytza.</p>

<p><a name="chronicle_english_17" id="chronicle_english_17"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_17">17.</a> In the year 1521, on the 13th day of August, the territory of Mexico
was taken by the Spaniards. The third attack on the same Spaniards took
place by all the towns here in the town of Cupul, when they asked Ah Ceh
Pech about the killing at Zalibna, and his companion-king Cen Pot of
Tixkokhoch of the province of Ticanto, with the priest Ich Kak Mo of
Itzmal the companion of Holtun Ake. The year in which the Span<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>iards
arrived at Chichen Itza for the second time to settle at Chichen Itza
was that when arrived the captain Don Francisco de Montejo, the just
one, leader of the Cupuls. They arrived at the town twenty years after
they arrived at Chichen Ytza (the first time), where they were called
eaters of anonas, biters of anonas.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_notes_18">Notes</a></span><a name="chronicle_english_18" id="chronicle_english_18"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_18">18.</a> In the year 1542, the Spaniards settled the territory of Merida; the
first speaker, the companion priest Kinich Kakmo and the king of the
Tutulxiu of the capital Mani humbled their heads, and the first families
were settled; then first they came under tribute the third time (the
Spaniards) came to this land, and they established themselves
permanently, and stopped here. The first time when they came here to
Chichen Itza they began to eat anonas; never before had anonas been
eaten, and when the Spaniards ate them they were called anona-eaters;
the second time they came to Chichen they stopped at the house of the
Captain Cupul; the third time they arrived they settled permanently, in
the year 1542 they settled permanently in the territory of Merida, the
13th Kan being the year-bearer, according to the Maya reckoning.</p>

Maya men for servants <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>because there were no men for servants at Merida;
they came to procure men for servants for their bidding; when they
reached Popce the tribute was increased by those from Merida, when those
who command arrived at Popce, and they went on to Tikom, and the
Spaniards remained at that time in Tikom more than twenty days before
they departed.</p>

and the chiefs were gathered together from Cauaca for the tribute, and
they gave in Cauca honey, pheasants and maize; then they placed in
prison the priest Caamal from Sisal, and asked for an account of all the
towns; one year he was kept by them in prison; he then served as guide
to the Spaniards when they came to Valladolid, and this priest Kamal of
Sisal entered as chief at Valladolid, and was called Don Juan Caamal de
la Cruz, because he spoke very truthfully; he first introduced the cross
in Cauaca, and he was listened to by the Spaniards, and for this he
entered as chief at Sisal, and being chief a long time he died. He was
also guide to the Spaniards when they went to war with Tixkochnah; and
when the Spaniards had been posted one year in Cauaca, they went forth
and came to Vallado<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>lid on purpose to see the men the chief Kamal had
placed in prison.</p>

this year Christianity began by the fathers of the order of San
Francisco in the port of Champoton; there first came the fathers having
in their hands the Redeemer Jesus Christ by name, that they might teach
the serving men; and first they came to the port of Champutun to the
west of this province called here Ichcansiho, then to Merida, the town
Ichcansiho as it is called. These are the names of the fathers who began
Christianity in this country Yucatan, Fr. Juan de la Puerta, and Fr.
Luis de Villarpando, and Fr. Diego de Becal, and Fr. Juan de Guerrero,
and Fr. Merchol de Benavente, these began Christianity in the west of
this country, before Christianity came here to Cupul; afterwards the
trumpet of Christianity came here, as I was saying, and it began here at
Cupul.</p>

country; on the 9th of November there had been peace for four months,
and it occurred on the 9th day of November of the year 1546 that there
was war after four months: it began and continued for one <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>year among the
men, when they were gathered together for the second time for the
tribute of wax; when the war began it took place that the conjurors came
from the west to deceive the people and to set in order the war; the
conjuror Cunul and Ah Camal came from the west and killed the Spaniards
and two sons of the Spaniards, scholars at Mena; they died at Chamax,
where they wished to remain; then came to Valladolid all the Spaniards
who were well when the war broke out, and then began the massacre; the
conjuror Camal Tipakan, of Pakam, killed Surusano over against Nicte; at
the towns one night the Spaniards were slain because the people fell
sick in their hands and feet; there was then for a day and a night war
in all the towns.</p>

<p><a name="chronicle_english_23" id="chronicle_english_23"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_23">23.</a> In the year 1547 a ship was destroyed by Ex Box at Ecab; then the
Spaniards went to make him fear, and made war against Box of Ecab, son
of Ek Box.</p>

Christianity.</p>

dependencies at Mani.</p>

from Valladolid to Sisal and he baptized the people and introduced
Christianity here into all the territory of Valladolid west of the
Chels; they came from Ecab, they came from Cozumel, they came from the
north, they came from the south, and also he began the building of the
monastery Valladolid-Sisal.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_notes_27">Notes</a></span><a name="chronicle_english_27" id="chronicle_english_27"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_27">27.</a> In the year 1552 the fathers settled here; in this year they came to
teach and sing here at Sisal, they came from the west to teach and sing
mass vespers with the singing of the organ and flute, and the canto
llano, which never before did we know here.</p>

<p>In the year 1553 the Auditor, Don Thomas Lopez arrived here in this land
of Yucatan from Castilla, and he arrived as a messenger from our great
ruler, the reigning king of Castilla, to protect us against the hand of
the Spaniards here. He put a stop to our being burned by the Spaniards,
he put a stop to our being bitten by dogs, he introduced the appointing
of chiefs in each village by the giving of the baton; he also adjusted
the tribute for the third time, the tribute introduced by the Spaniards,
mantles, wax, pheasants, maize, buckets, salt, peppers, broad beans,
narrow beans, jars, pots, vases, all for tribute to our Spanish <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>rulers,
which we paid before the Auditor had given his attention to these
things. At this time occurred the capture of the priest Chuuc by Ah
Macan Pech when we left Sisal, because he wished the priest Chuc to be
captured, as he had prevented the capture of Ah Ceh Pech here in Cupul;
afterwards the priest Pech, Macan Pech with the servants of Macan Pech
and his captains, came here to this town of Yaxkukul.</p>

Itza, here in this land, Yucatan, I have set forth the days, the months
and the years as above stated, I, Don Pablo Pech, the son of Don Martin
Pech of Xul Kum Cheel, conquistador, here at Maxtunil and Chac Xulub
Chen; since we received the Spaniards with good will and heart, nor did
we make war upon them, Don Juan de Montejo, Adelantado, and the rest of
the captains, as their names are in the book; we also first received
Christianity, we the conquistadores, Don Martin son of Don Fernando
Pech, Don Pablo Pech son of Don Martin Pech, on the 13th day of the
month of October, 1518; all my subjects received baptism in Maxtunil;
they were baptized by the first bishop to the Maya people, Don Francisco
Toral; and when he baptized us <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>our father the bishop showed the images
of the saints to all the villages, images of Saint Peter and St. Paul,
and St. John and St. Louis, and St. Antony, and St. Michael, and St.
Francis, and St. Alonzo, and St. Augustin and St. Sebastian, and St.
Diego; and they desired the oils, and he who was called Peter took the
oils.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_notes_29">Notes</a></span><a name="chronicle_english_29" id="chronicle_english_29"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_29">29.</a> Such is the chronicle of everything I have collected for the books,
in order that the people might know it, whoever wished to know it, as
had decreed it from the beginning our great lord God who governs the
universe. It is the declaration of how the Spaniards came to this land,
here to this country; by the will of the lord, the ruling God, also by
the orders of our lord Don Juan de Montejo, and Don Francisco de
Montejo, who first came here to this land, and gave orders that churches
should be built in the plastered villages, in the outlying districts,
and a town house and a temple for our great ruler, and also a public
house for travelers.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_notes_30">Notes</a></span><a name="chronicle_english_30" id="chronicle_english_30"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_30">30.</a> Thus also said our great father, Ah Naum Pech, Don Francisco de
Montejo Pech, and Don Juan Pech, as were their names when they were
baptized by the fathers; and as the Adelantado, the Captain, those who
came here to this land Yocol Peten, but called Yucatan by the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>Spaniards, as they the Spaniards, clearly relate. When our lord the
Spaniards said that we are to live eternally with God, and when the Maya
men heard the names, then spoke Naum Pech to those he commanded, with
suavity:&mdash;&#8220;Know ye, there comes to the town the one God, to the country
the true God, the sign of the true God; go ye to live with Him, joyfully
receive Him, do not war against Him, and if they have not to eat or
drink give them maize, fowls, pheasants, honey, beans to eat, that
Christianity may enter and that we may be servants of God;&#8221; thus they
wished it, and they did not make war, but rose up and went to aid the
Spaniards in the conquest and marched together with the foreigners.</p>

province Chichen Itza, that called Chichen Itza, and Ah Cahuot Cocom,
aiding the word of God and our great King, delivered up their standards
and banners for the sake of our great King, for the conquest, and
received the Adelantado and the father the priest in their towns, nor
did they make war, but abstained from all injury, and laid out churches
and town-houses for their followers.</p>

would be delivered the Catzins and Chuls in the district of Mani, and
the Tutulxiu, and the Chels in the East, and the (middle) Tan Cupuls and
in Campeche Na&#596;acab Canul; thus this earth was given by God to be
redeemed, this land Zacuholpatal Zacmutixtun; and Tunal Pech of Mutul
settled here in this town.</p>

on the day called 1 Ymix it will dawn, there will come from the eastern
lands bearded men with the sign of the only God to this land; go to
receive them with true pleasure;&#8221; therefore they went and marched under
the trees, under the branches, and they arrived at the house of Na&#596;ay
Cab, of Canul at Campech and said:&mdash;&#8220;He, your guest, is now coming, Ah
Na&#596;a Cab of Canul, receive him promptly.&#8221; Thus they said when the
ships appeared in the port of Campeche, when they saw the banners
waving, the white standard, and they came, when he had cast anchor, to
the Adelantado, and were asked in Castilian by the Christians, and the
Adelantado, whether they had been baptized; but they did not know his
language, and replied: &#8220;We do not understand the words;&#8221; so they said,
and thus they named this <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>land here Yucatan, (which was known to us as)
the land of the wild turkey, the land of the deer.</p>

Montejo went on; and they made much cloth and thread to cut into
clothing for the horses, as they wished to go to the town of Mani, to
the Tutulxiu. When they came to Yiba they held a talk in Yiba; they
arrived at Nohcacab coming out of Becal; thus the Spaniards passed and
arrived at Mani, to Tutulxiu, and then were appointed the chief Ikeb,
the chief Caixicum and the chief Chuc to go to invite Ah Cuat Cocom.
They were at first taken and placed in a cave by his followers: then
their eyes were put out in that great cave of weasels, and there was not
one who did not have his eyes put out in the cave of weasels; their eyes
were put out and they were given the road to go groping to the
Adelantado at Mani; and thus returned those who were cast out of the
town of Cuat Cocom. Then Ah Naum Pech rose up with both of them and came
to Ah Cuat Cocom; when they arrived, he said to Ah Naum Pech that he had
not seen nor heard of it; he said he had gone to Chichen Itza, and he
came promptly to the towns with the Pechs, and they arrived at Mani to
deliver up promptly (the offenders); <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>and the Cocom said he had not
witnessed what had happened in his village, and he would give permission
that they should be taken who had done it.</p>

in them; the Spaniards also came, but on account of the massacre of the
foreigners by the people, they passed on and went to Ah Batum Pech of
Chel, whom they saw, and passed on, and went to Maxtunil, to Nachi May
and Ah Macan Pech; they then returned to their lands to the towns they
governed at Yaxkukul; Don Pablo Pech, Ah Macan Pech, was governor of all
the district to the west, nor did his captains at all give up their
spirits; soon I was appointed to guard the territory Chac Xulub Chen,
because the serving men were at war on account of the labor given them,
and by taking them the will of God was fulfilled in the towns.</p>

first fathers were received, and the names of the first conquerors I
shall set forth according to the register, because this is composed in
order that it may be known how the conquest occurred, and in what manner
they labored here, under the trees, under the <a name="corr26" id="corr26"></a><ins class="correction" title="branches,">branches</ins> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>under the bushes,
in those years and months; and what the people and their sons found to
eat; for from two to three years they labored in the distribution of the
towns, by our rulers the Spaniards; they also labored in the measuring
of the towns, and the measuring of the forests of the towns by the
Auditor Tomas Lopez, holding in his hand the Cedula of our great lord
the king, that forests should be cut by whoever settled. When there were
no towns we were natives here of official houses, Naum Pech being
governor of all, nor at that time had the Spaniards come here to
establish Christianity in this land; but when the day came that their
arrival took place, when the Spaniards came to this land Yucatan, we
received them with a friendly heart, and Christianity was introduced
into this land, and we were appointed to guard the villages, when as yet
there was no church; and now they have ceased building official houses
or villages.</p>

<p><a name="chronicle_english_37" id="chronicle_english_37"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_37">37.</a> Thus I began to relate how the conquest took place and how many
sufferings we underwent with our lords, the Spaniards, from the natives
who were not willing to deliver themselves to God; thus I recount what I
heard concerning the town Maxtunil.</p>

and when the Holy Church was finished in Cumtal, we measured its sides
and took possession so that our children should remain there from the
beginning until the end of the world, so that the natives should not
obstruct us, nor enchant by the throwing of stones anything which had
been given us by God and our lord through the fear of our hearts; for
this our great lord the ruling king gave us the authority; and when the
church was prepared in which to worship our lord and God, and the public
house to the east of the church and the temple of our great king and the
residence.</p>

the natives may not in the future say that it belongs to them, for this
I show forth the occurrences as I did them with my father, I, Don Pablo
Pech, Ah Macan Pech, and my father Don Martin Pech, Ah Com Pech, my lord
Se&ntilde;or Don Ambrosio Pech, his native name being Op Pech, and Ixil Yzam
Pech, and Don Esteban Pech, Ah Culub Pech.</p>

<p><a name="chronicle_english_40" id="chronicle_english_40"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_40">40.</a> We received the royal commissions to measure the forests. The
license was given by our great monarch the ruling king through our <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>lord
the first auditor, Tomas Lopez, that he should give us years ago his
order that the uncultivated fields should be measured wherever they are,
here back of the town, that we may know where the boundaries of our
lands pass in order that parents and children may maintain them and give
food to the Encomenderos. Therefore I swear before the people that this
information is true, that they may have it in sight so that no
uncultivated field shall entrench upon another uncultivated field; for
this reason I set forth the truth.</p>

<p><a name="chronicle_english_41" id="chronicle_english_41"></a><a href="#chronicle_maya_41">41.</a> The first Encomendero here in Chac Xulub Chen was Don Julian Doncel,
who ordered the chiefs that they should go to place the marks of the
limits of their forest lands here back of the towns they governed, and
thus they were led to measure the boundaries of their lands and the
forests toward the East, the South and the West, for the benefit of all
who dwell therein; because already Christianity was established in this
land of Chac Xulub Chen with our holy lord Santiago the patron who
guards the town of Don Pablo Pech.</p>

<p class="parthead">NOTES.</p>

<hr class="chapopen" />

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_1">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_1">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_1" id="chronicle_notes_1"></a>1. &#8220;The fifth division of the 11th Ahau Katun was placed&#8221; (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in
the wall or in the Katun Stone), (see page <a href="#Page_57">57</a>, where this expression is
explained). In other words, the first arrival of the Spaniards at Merida
took place at the close of the 11th Ahau Katun. This was July, 1541, and
it is in gratifying conformity with Bishop Landa, who also states that
that month was the commencement of a 20-year period; but he says that at
that date the 11th Katun began, while Pech goes on to say that it was
the next in order, the 9th. (See Landa, <i>Relacion</i>, p. 314.)</p>

<p><i>Noh cah te ti Ho</i>, the great town at Ho. This was the native name of
the ancient city which stood on the present site of Merida, and, by the
Mayas, is in use to this day. <i>Ho</i> is the numeral 5, and some have
supposed that the name was given on account of five large mounds or
buildings said to have been conspicuous in the ancient city. That there
were precisely five is not positively stated by the old historians,
though four are specified. This theory would suppose that the name was
given to the city only after these large structures were completed, and
that its name during that time had been lost. But this is not
improbable.</p>

<p>In fact, the ancient name of Merida was not Ho, but <i>Ichcanzihoo</i>, as
appears from a later passage in Pech&#8217;s narrative and from numerous
others in the Books of Chilan Balam. <i>Ho</i> is only the abbreviation of
this long name. It ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>pears to mean &#8220;The five (temples) of many
serpents.&#8221; <i>Can</i> is the generic term for serpent, and <i>ich</i> used as a
prefix denotes a place where there is an abundance of what the noun
means: thus <i>ichche</i>=a place where the trees are tall and dense;
<i>ichxiu</i>, a place where the grass is tall and thick (<i>Diccionario de
Motul</i>). The serpents were probably those sculptured in stone or painted
on the walls. This theory receives additional probability from an entry
in the <i>Diccionario de Motul</i>, MS., which relates that the largest mound
in ancient Merida, situated back of the present convent of San
Francisco, was called by the natives <i>ahchuncan</i>, and that this was the
name of the idol which used to be worshiped there. Its signification
would be &#8220;the first or primitive serpent,&#8221; or &#8220;the first speaker,&#8221;
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> oracle, as <i>can</i> means both serpent and speech.</p>

<p>The temples at Ho were not in use when the Spaniards arrived, nor had
they been for many generations. Apparently only a few huts of wood and
straw made up the village, while these vast ruins were even then covered
to the summit with a heavy growth of timber in all respects like the
virgin forest around them. This is clearly stated by the Friar Lorenzo
de Bienvenida, who came to Merida in 1545. I quote his expressions from
a letter to the King in 1548:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;La ciudad esta la tierra adentro treinta y tres leguas; llamase la
<i>ciudad de Merida</i>; pusieronle asi por los edificios superbos que hai en
ella, que en todo lo descubierto en Indias no se han hallado tan
superbos edificios, de canteria bien labrada, i grandes las piedras; no
hai memoria de quien los hiz&oacute;; parecenos que se hicieron antes de la
venida de Christo porque tan grande estaba el monte encima dellos como
en lo bajo de la tierra; son altos de cinco estados de piedra seca i
encima los edificios, quatro quartos todo de celdas como de <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>Frailes, de
veinte pies de luengo i de diez de ancho, i todas las portadas de una
piedra, lo alto de la puerta i de boveda, i destos hai en la tierra
otros muchos. Esta gente natural no habitaba en ellos, ni hacen casa
sino de paja y madera, habiendo mas apareja de cal i piedra que en todo
lo descubierto. En estos edificios tomamos sitio los Frailes para casa
de San Francisco; lo que habia sido cultura de demonios, justo es que
sea templo donde se sirve &agrave; Dios, etc.&#8221; (<i>Carta de Fr. Lorenzo de
Bienvenida, 1548, MS.</i>)</p>

<p>The date, 1511, given as that of the first arrival of the Spaniards,
refers to the shipwreck of Aguilar and his companions, who in that year
were thrown on the eastern coast.</p>

<p>This introductory paragraph was entirely <a name="corr27" id="corr27"></a><ins class="correction" title="misconstrued">miscontrued</ins> by Avila, and
nearly as much so by Brasseur. I add their translations to illustrate
this.</p>


<p class="titlepage"><i>Translation of Avila.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A la quinta vez que sent&oacute; el noveno Rey en la guerra cuando llegaron
los Espa&ntilde;oles que se poblaron en la ciudad de Merida, el principal Rey
de esa ciudad era siempre cacique y el a&ntilde;o en que llegaron los Se&ntilde;ores
Espa&ntilde;oles aqui en esta suelo fu&eacute; el de 1511.&#8221;</p>


<p class="titlepage"><i>Translation of Brasseur.</i></p>

<p>It will be seen that the former completely travesties the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>passage, while
the latter mistakes the proper names and destroys the chronological
value of the dates given.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_2">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_2">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_2" id="chronicle_notes_2"></a>2. <i>Hidalgos conquistadoren</i>, Spanish titles which we are surprised to
find a native claiming; but later on (&sect; 9) he informs us that he was
authorized to employ them by the Spanish officials.</p>

<p>Chichinica was a pueblo near Chicxulub, which is now no longer in
existence.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_3">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_3">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_3" id="chronicle_notes_3"></a>3. <i>Ti ma ococ haa tin pol cuchi</i>, &#8220;formerly, when the water will not
entered to my head&#8221; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, before I was baptized. This complicated
construction of the negative (<i>ma</i>), a future (<i>ococ</i> from <i>ocol</i>) and
the sign of the past tense (<i>cuchi</i>), also occurs on an earlier page
(98), where we have the sentence <i>uacppel haab u binel ma &#596;ococ u
xocol oxlahun ahau cuchi</i>, six years before the end of the 13th ahau.
<i>Ocol haa</i>, syncopated to <i>ocola</i>, and even <i>oca</i>, was the usual term
for Christian baptism.</p>

<p>Xulkumcheel was a pueblo which does not seem to have survived.</p>

<p><i>Ah Naum Pech, likul tu cah Mutul.</i> Ah Naum Pech from, or native of, the
town Mutul. The latter is the modern Motul, about 22 miles easterly from
Chicxulub. The name is also spelled Mutul by Cogolludo (<i>Historia de
Yucatan</i>, Lib. VI, cap. VII).</p>

<p><i>Halach uinic</i>, previously explained, was the ancient native title of
chief of a village. It is the same word which Oviedo, in his report of
Grijalva&#8217;s expedition deforms into <i>calachini</i> (<i>Historia de las
Indias</i>, Lib. XVII).</p>

<p>The date, 1519, like various others in the narrative, appears to have
been erroneously entered or copied. It should probably be 1539.
<i>Maxtunil</i> does not at present exist. <i>&#390;ilam</i> is a town <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>north of
Itzamal, near the sea coast. It is by some identified as the spot where
Francisco de Montejo embarked after his retreat from Chichen Itza, in
1528.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_4">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_4">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_4" id="chronicle_notes_4"></a>4. The <i>Kupuls</i> were the family who reigned in the eastern province,
where Valladolid was founded. They long retained their hostility to the
Spaniards. <i>Ekab</i> was situated on the coast opposite the island of
Cozumel. <i>&#390;ekom</i> should probably read Tekom. <i>Tixcuumcuuc</i> no longer
exists. <i>Tinuum</i> is a town 4 leagues north of Valladolid, on the road to
Itzamal. <i>&#390;i &#390;antun</i> is a town north of Itzamal, said by Sanchez
Aguilar to have been the ancient capital of the princely house of the
Chels. <i>Ake</i> is probably the modern &#390;onatak&eacute;. <i>Catzim</i> is now the name
of a hacienda in the Department of Itzamal, some distance from the
coast. <i>&#390;elebna</i> is unknown.</p>

<p>The expression <i>tumen naob Bon cupul</i>, translated by Avila &#8220;porque esa
casa es de Bon Cupul,&#8221; I think is an error of the copyist for <i>tumen
nacon Cupul</i>. See also <a href="#chronicle_notes_18">&sect; 18</a>.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_5">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_5">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_5" id="chronicle_notes_5"></a>5. <i>Hokzah uba</i>, they betook themselves. The termination <i>uba</i> is that
of the third person of reflexive verbs.</p>

<p>Nachi May, already mentioned, was a member of an ancient princely house
mentioned by Landa and Sanchez Aguilar. One of them, Ahkin May, was
apparently the hereditary high priest. The effort has been made to
derive from their name the word <i>Maya</i>, and Brasseur would carry us to
Haiti in order to discover its meaning (Landa, <i>Relacion</i>, p. 42, note),
but this is unnecessary. <i>May</i> in the Maya tongue means &#8220;a hoof,&#8221; as of
a deer, and is a proper name still in use. There is no reason to suppose
it in any way connected with <i>Maya</i>.</p>

<p><i>Matanok</i> I take to be an error for <i>matanon</i>, from <i>mat</i> (pret.
<i>matnahi</i>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_6">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_6">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_6" id="chronicle_notes_6"></a>6. <i>&#390;ibikal</i> may be, as suggested by Dr. Berendt, Tipikal, a town in
the district of Merida. There is another of the name in the Sierra Alta
(<i>Estadistica de Yucatan</i>, 1814).</p>

<p>Francisco de Bracamonte is mentioned by Cogolludo as among the first
settlers of Merida.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_7">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_7">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_7" id="chronicle_notes_7"></a>7. Cogolludo mentions Rodrigo Alvarez as &#8220;Escribano del juzgado,&#8221; who
came with Montejo (<i>Historia de Yucatan</i>, Lib. III, cap. VI, and
elsewhere).</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_8">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_8">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_8" id="chronicle_notes_8"></a>8. <i>U toxol cahob</i>, the distribution of the towns, literally &#8220;the

1558. (Cogolludo, <i>Hist. de Yucatan</i>, Lib. V. cap. XV.)</p>

of the remainder of the history, and inserted in order to corroborate
the statement just made by his father, that the latter had transferred
the magistracy to him.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_11">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_11">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_11" id="chronicle_notes_11"></a>11. The <i>holpop</i>, literally &#8220;head of the mat,&#8221; perhaps because when the
company sat around or on the mat his place was at its head, was the
official who had charge of the <i>tunkul</i> or wooden drum, with which
public meetings, dances, summons to war, etc. were proclaimed, and with
which the priests accompanied their voices in reciting the ancient
chants (Cogolludo, <i>Hist. de Yucatan</i>, Lib. IV, cap. V). He was called
<i>ahholpop</i>, and had charge of the public hall of the village, the
<i>popolna</i>, &#8220;casa de comunidad,&#8221; in which public business was transacted
(<i>Diccionario de Motul</i>, <a name="corr29" id="corr29"></a><ins class="correction" title="MS.).">MS.)</ins></p>

<p>The <i>ahkulel</i> was the official second in command in a town or district.
He acted in place of the <i>batab</i> or the <i>ahcuchcab</i>. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>The verb <i>kulel</i>
means to transact business for another, to act as deputy.</p>

<p><i>Ahkin</i> was the ordinary word for priest in the old language; kin, sun,
day, time; <i>ahkin</i>, he who was familiar with the days and times, with
the calendar, and also with the past and the future.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_12">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_12">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_12" id="chronicle_notes_12"></a>12. <i>U chun u thanob</i>; the <i>chunthan</i> or <i>ahchunthan</i>, literally, he who
has the first word, was the member of the village who took the leading
part in matters of business. The office and name are still in existence
in the native village communities of Yucatan. (See Garcia y Garcia,
<i>Historia de la Guerra de Castas en Yucatan</i>, Introd., p. xli.)</p>

<p>The <i>ahkul</i> was an envoy or messenger, who carried the orders of the
prince to his people and to foreign princes. The title was usually
prefixed to the name of the person.</p>

<p>The <i>holcan</i>, &#8220;head caller,&#8221; was a military official in each village,
whose duty it was when war was announced to summon the men in his
district capable of bearing arms (see Landa, <i>Relacion</i>, p. 174). The
Spanish writers translate it by <i>alferez</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>nacon</i> was an elective war chief, who held his position for the
term of three years (Landa, <i>Relacion</i>, pp. 161, 173). The name is
derived from <i>nacal</i>, to rise, go up, and hence as a delegate or elected
representative (as is stated by the <i>Dicc. de Motul</i>).</p>

with water. The word <i>tuce</i> (or, it may be, <i>tuze</i>) I do not find in any
dictionary, nor does Avila translate it. The passage is an obscure one.
Avila renders it &#8220;cuando fuimos &agrave; la guerra, bebian pi&ntilde;ole y <i>tuce</i>,
porque estaban enojados con los Cristianos.&#8221; Possibly these were two
articles of food especially used on warlike raids.</p>

<p><i>U zahacil in puczical</i>, a cant phrase probably borrowed from the
missionaries=&#8220;the fear of my heart,&#8221;&mdash;in my humbleness. <i>Puczikal</i>
appears to be a root-word, though of three syllables. It means the heart
of men and animals, also the mind or soul, the desires, and the interior
of certain growths, as the pith of maize, etc. (<i>Dicc. de Motul.</i>)</p>

<p>The year 1511 was that of the shipwreck of the deacon Geronimo de
Aguilar and his companions, who were the first whites known to the
natives of Yucatan.</p>

<p>The reference which is made in this section to a deputation of fifty
natives to Spain, is not mentioned, so far as I remember, by other
historians. As in some respects my translation differs from that of
Avila, I give his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cuando lleg&ograve; ante el monarca Ahmacan Pech, D<sup class="supera">on</sup> Pedro Pech, y sus
deudos, sus primeros descendientes, sus capitanes, todos fueron con el
para honrar el monarca y vea la cara &aacute; sus vasallos indigenas, y escogi&oacute;
cincuenta de los grandes de ellos para llevar tras de el al monarca
reinante para servirlos en la mesa alli lejos en Espa&ntilde;a, pero los que
vomitaron en el festejo delante del monarca reinante, esos entonces dij&ograve;
el Rey que pagaron tributos todos y todos sus descendientes, mas
nosotros los Peches,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>The phrase <i>mac xenahi tu tzicile</i> Avila translates &#8220;who vomited at the
feasts;&#8221; but I believe <i>xenhi</i>, vomited, is a misreading for <i>xanhi</i>,
remained, and <i>tzicil</i> is obedience, as serving-men.</p>

<p><i>Lae te hantabi</i>, who was eaten; Aguilar himself was not eaten, as he
was rescued by Cortes, in 1519, and served him as interpreter. But some
of his companions were eaten by the natives, not of Cozumel, but of the
coast to the south, and this is what Pech meant to say, unless,
indeed&mdash;and I am inclined to prefer this view&mdash;we read <i>hantezahbi</i>
instead of <i>hantabi</i>, which would give the sense &#8220;the land was
discovered by Aguilar, who was given food (supported, maintained) by Ah
Naum,&#8221; etc. For particulars about Aguilar see Herrera, <i>Hist. de las
Indias</i>, Dec. II, Lib. IV, cap. VIII.</p>

<p><i>Lai yabil hauic</i>, etc. This is an important sentence, as fixing a date
in the ancient chronology. <i>U tunil balcah</i> is an ancient term, not
explained in the dictionaries. <i>Balcah</i> (or <i>baalcah</i>) means &#8220;a town and
the people who compose it&#8221; (Pio Perez, <i>Diccionario</i>), hence people, the
world, as the French use <i>monde</i>. From many references in the Maya
manuscripts I derive the impression that the last stone in the katun
pillar was placed in turn by the towns, each giving its name to the
stone and the cycle (see ante, p. <a href="#Page_171">171</a>).</p>

<p>Assuming the correctness of the figures 1517&mdash;and there is no reason to
doubt it&mdash;then Pech counted the katuns as of 24 years each, as Pio Perez
maintained was correct; because he has already informed us in his
introductory paragraph that the year 1541 was the close of the 11th
Ahau, and 1541-1517=24.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_16">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_16">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_16" id="chronicle_notes_16"></a>16. The two previous visits referred to were probably those of Cordova,
1517, and Grijalva, 1518. &#8220;Those who knew <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>to speak the true words,&#8221;
refers to the Catholic priests. All the historians of Cortes&#8217; expedition
dwell on the effect produced on the natives of Cozumel by the religious
services he held there.</p>

<p>The date, Feb. 28, 1519, seems correct, although it is not mentioned by
any other writer I have at hand. Cortes left Havana, Feb. 19.</p>

<p><i>Lai yabil</i>, &#8220;in this year,&#8221; evidently a date is omitted, as the first
arrival of the Spaniards at Chichen Itza was either at the close of 1526
or beginning of 1527. One of the Maya MSS. gives the year as <i>bulucil
Muluc</i>, the 11th Muluc. The Maya year, it will be remembered, began on
the 16th of July.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was on the memorable thirteenth of August, 1521, the day of St.
Hippolytus, that Cortes led his warlike array for the last time across
the black and blasted environs which lay around the Indian capital,
etc.&#8221; Prescott, <i>Conquest of Mexico</i>, Book VI, chap. VIII. There is
little doubt but that the tidings of the dreadful destruction of the
mighty Tenochtitlan was rapidly disseminated among the tribes far down
into Yucatan and Central America, and made a profound impression on
them.</p>

<p>This section is confused and difficult. Avila translates:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fueron atacados por tercera vez los mismos Espa&ntilde;oles por todos los
pueblos aqui en el pueblo de Cupul cuando hallaron &agrave; Ah Ceh Pech
muriendose en una casa no embarrada y &agrave; su compa&ntilde;ero el otro Rey Cen
Pot,&#8221; etc.</p>

1542.</p>

<p>The anona or custard-apple does not seem to have been eaten by the
natives, and it impressed them as strange and somewhat unnatural to
witness the Spaniards suck them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span><i>Ca u tocahob nao bon Cupul</i>; this is translated by Se&ntilde;or Avila:
&#8220;quemaron al capitan Cupul:&#8221; they burned the captain Cupul; but I take
it to be a misreading for <i>ca u yotochob nacom Cupul</i>, and have so
translated it. There is no account of a leader of the Cupuls having been
burned, and, moreover, this is in accordance with &sect; 4.</p>

<p>Another important chronological statement is made in this section, to
wit, that the year 1542 (I suppose July 16, 1541-July 15, 1542 is meant)
was 13 Kan. As Pech has already told us that it was also the first year
of the 9th Ahau Katun, we have the date fixed in both methods of
reckoning, that is, by the Kin Katun as well as the Ahau Katun,
according to the calendar which his family used.</p>

find Popce on any of the maps. The Chels were a well known princely
family in ancient Yucatan. The <i>Dicc. de Motul</i> says their province was
that of &#390;izantun.</p>

some companions whose names have not been preserved, 1531 to 1534 (see
Geronimo de Mendieta, <i>Historia Eclesiastica Indiana</i>, pp. 380, 665;
Torquemada. <i>Monarquia Indiana</i>, Lib. IX, cap. XIII, Lib. XX, cap.
XLVII). They were stationed at Champoton and did not penetrate the
country. The next attempt was in 1537. Testera, then Provincial of
Mexico, sent five Franciscan friars, who returned after two years of
efforts. Their names are unknown (Cogolludo, <i>Historia de Yucatan</i>, vol.
I, pp. 175, 182). The third <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>is the one referred to in the text. Its
commissary was Fr. Luis de Villalpando, and its members were Fr. Lorenzo
de Bienvenida, Fr. Melchor de Benavente, Fr. Juan de Herrera, Fr. Juan
de Albalata, and Fr. Angel Maldonado. Five other missionaries came with
Juan de la Puerta, in 1548 (Cogolludo).</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_22">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_22">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_22" id="chronicle_notes_22"></a>22. The term <i>ahetzil</i>, I do not find, and translate it as <i>ahe&#596;il</i>,
the practice of conjuring, or sorcery. But it is quite possibly for
<i>ahuitzil</i>, dwellers in the sierra. The next line is corrupt, and I can
only guess at the meaning. The date, Nov. 9, 1546, is correct, and the
history here given of the insurrection of the natives at that time is
substantially the same as is told at length by Cogolludo (<i>Hist. de
Yucatan</i>, Lib. V, cap. VII).</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_27">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_27">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_27" id="chronicle_notes_27"></a>27. The Auditor Tomas Lopez came from Guatemala (not Spain) to Yucatan
in 1551 or 1552, and in the latter year promulgated his &#8220;Laws&#8221; for the
government of the natives, many of which are given in Cogolludo&#8217;s
History.</p>

<p>The passing reference to the cruelties of the Spaniards are more than
borne out by the testimony of Fr. Lorenzo de Bienvenida. Writing to the
King in 1548 he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;En esta villa (Valladolid) se levantaron este a&ntilde;o de quarenta y siete
los Indios *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* i este levantamiento por mal tratamiento que hacen &agrave;

the seaport, Coni, the eastern coast, where Montejo landed on his first
expedition. Bishop Toral did not arrive in Yucatan until 1562, so the
mention of him proves that this narrative was written after that date.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_29">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_29">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_29" id="chronicle_notes_29"></a>29. No such person as Juan de Montejo is known.</p>

and afterwards altered to <i>Yucalpeten</i>. This latter occurs as a name
applied to the peninsula, or a portion of it, in a number of passages of
the Book of Chilan Balam of Chumayel. These have been quoted by the
Canon Crescencio Carrillo in a recent work (<i>Historia Antigua de
Yucatan</i>, pp. 137, 140, Merida, 1882), to support his view that the name
Yucatan is an abbreviation of Yucalpeten.</p>

<p>Apart from the difficulty of explaining such an extensive abbreviation,
which is not at all in the spirit of the Maya tongue, the words of Pech
in this section and &sect; 33 conclusively <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>prove that the two names are
entirely distinct in origin. Carrillo is of opinion that <i>yucal</i> should
be divided into <i>y</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>cal</i>, and he translates the name &#8220;la perla de
la garganta de la tierra &ograve; continente.&#8221; This appears far-fetched.
<i>Yocal</i> is probably merely <i>yoc hail</i>, upon the water (<i>il</i>,
determinative ending denoting what water); hence <i>yocal peten</i>, the
region upon the water, applied to Yucatan or some part of its coast
district. The <i>h</i> is nearly mute and frequently elided, as in <i>ocola</i>
(<i>ocol haa</i>) to baptize.</p>

<p>A prophecy of the priest Pech, which is perhaps the one here referred
to, appears in several of the Books of Chilan Balam, and also Spanish
translations of it in the Histories of Lizana and Cogolludo, and a
French version in Brasseur&#8217;s report of the <i>Mission Scientifique au
Mexique</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The text is quite corrupt, but I insert it as I have emended it from a
comparison of three copies.</p>

<p>The only line in which I have taken much liberty with the text is the
fifth, where, after the word <i>kue</i>, one MS. reads: <i>yok taa ba akauba</i>,
and another, <i>yok lac kauba</i>, neither of which is intelligible.</p>

<p>If the date assigned in these lines be a correct one, they were
delivered by the prophet in 1469. It is not impossible. The words are
obscure and the prediction so indistinct that it might quite well have
been made by an official augur at that time.</p>

Zotuta when Montejo made his settlement at Merida, and was a determined
enemy of the Spaniards. He was defeated in 1542, in a sanguinary battle,
and then accepted terms of peace. I have in my possession the copy of a
survey which he made of the lands of the town of Zotuta in 1545, when he
was evidently on good terms with the Conquerors.</p>

Yucatecan families, and many who bear them are still found among the
natives (Berendt, <i>Nombres Proprios en Lengua Maya</i>, <a name="corr33" id="corr33"></a><ins class="correction" title="MS.).">MS.)</ins></p>

<p>The words Zacuholpatal Zacmutixtun are rendered by Avila as proper
names, and I have followed his example. I have not found a satisfactory
explanation of them.</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_33">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_33">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_33" id="chronicle_notes_33"></a>33. The day <i>One Imix</i> was a day of peculiar sanctity in ancient
Yucatan. Landa makes the rather unintelligible assertion that the count
of their days, or their calendar, invariably commenced on that day
(<i>Relacion</i>, p. 236).</p>

<p>Imix is the 18th day of the month, and it is <a name="corr34" id="corr34"></a><ins class="correction" title="possible">possibly</ins> that it and
the two following days were used for intercalary days.</p>

<p>More to the purpose of explaining the prophecy in the text is the
statement of Francisco Hernandez, who, as reported by Bishop Las Casas,
relates that in the mythology of the Mayas, the god or gods Bacab, those
who support the four corners of the heaven and who are identified with
the &#8220;year bearers&#8221; or Dominical days of the calendar, died on the day
One Imix, and after three days came to life again. (Las Casas, <i>Historia
Apologetica de las Indias Occidentales</i>, cap. CXXIII.) This has
reference apparently to the intercalary days Imix, Ik, and Akbal, which
were counted so as to allow the next Kin Katun period to begin on
<a name="corr35" id="corr35"></a><ins class="correction" title="1">I</ins> Kan. I have explained this theory fully in a paper, &#8220;Notes on
the Codex Troano and Maya Chronology,&#8221; in the <i>American Naturalist</i>,
Sept. 1881. Naturally this was supposed by the Spanish missionaries to
be a reference to Christian traditions.</p>

<p><i>Ca tip u chemob</i>, when the ships were rocking; <i>tipil</i> represents the
slipping and sliding movement of a partially submerged or hidden body;
thus the beating of the heart and the pulse is <i>tipilac</i>. <i>Ca yumtah
banderas ob</i>, when the banners <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>waved; <i>yumtah</i> is to swing to and fro as
a hamack or a flag. <i>Piixtahob</i>, from <i>pixitah</i>, to unreel or reel off
yarn, etc., from a spindle. I suppose it refers to letting go the
anchor.</p>

<p>The derivation of the name Yucatan here given is interesting, for
several reasons. In the first place, it makes it evident that Pech did
not believe it was an abbreviation of Yucalpeten (see ante, page <a href="#Page_255">255</a>).
Again, although it has very often been stated that the name arose from a
misunderstanding of some native words by the Spaniards, there has been
no uniformity of opinion as to what these words were. Several of the
phrases suggested have been such as have no meaning in the Maya tongue;
(see full discussions of the question in Eligio Ancona, <i>Historia de
Yucatan</i>, Vol. I, pp. 219, 220, and Crescencio Carrillo, <i>Historia
Antigua de Yucatan</i>, cap. V.) As given by Pech it is perfectly
intelligible and good Maya. Without syncope it would be &#8220;<i>Matan ca ubah
a than</i>&#8221; shortened to &#8220;<i>Ma c&#8217;ubah </i><a name="corr36" id="corr36"></a><ins class="correction" title="than,&#8221;"><i>than</i>,</ins> &#8220;We do not understand
your speech.&#8221; Pech is in error, however, in supposing that the name
arose on the arrival of Montejo; it was in use immediately after the
expedition of Cordova (1517), and if Bernal Diaz was correct in his
recollection, was applied to the land by the Indians Cordova brought
back to Cuba with him from the Bay of Campeachy. (See Bernal Diaz,
<i>Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de Nueva Espa&ntilde;a</i>, cap. VII.)</p>

<p><span class="notes"><a href="#chronicle_maya_34">Maya</a><br /><a href="#chronicle_english_34">English</a></span><a name="chronicle_notes_34" id="chronicle_notes_34"></a>34. This is no doubt the same occurrence which is described at
considerable length by Cogolludo, <i>Hist. de Yucatan</i>, Lib. III, cap. VI.
But the details differ very much and the names of the messengers and the
chief to whom they were sent are not identical. I believe this
discrepancy can be explained, but it would extend this note too far to
go into the subject here. The word <i>yacatunzabin</i>, which Avila renders
&#8220;en <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>dicha cueva,&#8221; seems a compound of <i>y</i>, <i>actun</i>, <i>zabin</i>. The last is
the name of the weasel; <i>actun</i> means both a cave and a stone house. By
some it is supposed to be a compound of <i>ac</i>, tortoise, and <i>tun</i>,
stone, a cave resembling a hollow tortoise shell.</p>

they shall not destroy&#8221;; but the word <i>cuntahbal</i>, from <i>cun</i>, <i>cumtah</i>,
means that which is to be enchanted, and <i>c&#295;inal</i> is the throwing of
stones. I suppose, therefore, it refers to some act of shamanism the
design of which was to injure a neighbor.</p>
